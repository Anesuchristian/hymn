            content: [
                "I was born on the **25th of October, 1918** at **Holy Cross Mission**, **Chirumanzu District**, near the small town of **Mvuma**. I was baptised **Paul** by **Father Schmidt** a Roman Catholic Priest. My mother **Saramina**, who herself was a devout Christian, had initially named me **Mamvura***. After the death of my father **Joseph Mugovera Mwazha**, our family moved to **Kwenda Village** in **Njanja**, **Charter District** (now Chikomba) near the town of **Chivhu**, in then the **Midlands Province** of **Zimbabwe**",
                "In **1929** I started learning the **Roman Catholic Catechism** from my uncle **Nyamayedenga**, who was my mother's brother. We recited the **Lord's prayer** every night before retiring to bed and each morning as the family woke up to a new day. I had not learnt to read and write but could say the **Lord's prayer**. It was also at this time that I learnt to respond to questions of the holy scripture. I began to understand that the **Lord God** was my **Father in Heaven** and **Jesus Christ my Saviour**."
            ],
            footnote: "* **Mamvura** means \"Child of the Water\". My mother had the notion that I was not going to survive beyond infancy. At that time most infants lost their lives to the scourge of the plagious disease influenza. Hence if I died I was going to be buried in the muddy, wet marshy river banks. (An African custom for dead infants). It was not long after I was born that I was seriously ill with this highly contagious fever and as my mother expected, I must have passed away. This prompted my mother to rush me for baptism and the last rites at the altar in the church before burial proceedings were conducted. To the amazement of everyone I seemed to spring back to life through the baptism done in the Name of the Father, the Son and the Holy Spirit. Father Schmidt and the congregation where filled by the Holy Spirit and uttered, \"The child has been raied for a mission,\" three times."

            subtitle: "MY PRAYERS ARE ANSWERED AND JESUS CHRIST REVEALS HIMSELF TO ME: 1931-1936",
            content: [
                "I began my education at Masvaure Methodist School in Kwenda, Chivhu, when I was twelve years old. Meanwhile, the love of Jesus imbued my soul. I recall that as I tracked alone to and from school the Lord Jesus would often come in my mind and each time this happened, I would be overwhelmed by a strong feeling of closeness to Him. Tears would throb increasingly.",
                "Everytime this happened, I would walk off the dirt path into the thick bush and pray to God and then resume my journey. This deep emotion began to encroach in me as we said the Lord’s prayer in class. The love for Christ the Lord would again fill my heart and my eyes would swell up with tears. After praying I almost always asked for permission to go outside and would proceed to a nearby bush for more prayers. I would kneel and pray tearfully. At the end of the school day, on my way home, I prayed to myself and often stopped to pray in the forest. Frequent moments of prayer occupied most of my thoughts wherever I would be, whether I was working in the fields or doing any other odd tasks, I would down tools, and as my heart pulsated with love I felt for the Lord, and with tears rolling down my cheeks, I would kneel to pray. Each time I prayed Christ Jesus would fill my heart with joyfulness. I would experience so much joy. It has remained beyond my human capability to explain the extent of such immense pleasure.",
                "2. The heart throbbing, the tears and the praying became a habit with me. One afternoon in 1933 when I was in Standard One, the Lord God planted in me faith in Jesus.",
                "As I now reflect, I remember this took place simply as follows; I had asked Amai Saramina for two shillings and sixpence (or in today’s money twenty five cents) which was enough to send off to Harare to pay for a warm jersey. Amai Saramina said no. So I went behind the homestead onto the nearby rocks and began to pray.",
                "\"Oh God, you who are my father. I have no father on this earth because you took him away. Please talk to my mother so that she feels sorry for me and she can give me the money I asked her to send to Harare for the jersey.\"",
                "God answered immediately. I heard my mother calling, \"Mamvura, Mamvura!\" I answered and she said, \"Come. Go and fetch water at the well and then you can take the two shillings and sixpence you requested to Mr Huchu. He can buy you the jersey you want. Hurry up now, it is nearly sunset.\"",
                "I got up from where I was still kneeling, rushed home, picked up the large clay water pot and set off to fetch the water. Amai Saramina gave me the money I had asked for and I ran to Mr Huchu, praying, and giving my thanks to our Father who is in heaven. I kept saying, \"I thank you my Father, it is you who gave me this money. I thank you.\"",
                "It was indeed from this day that I was totally convinced and left with no doubt at all that my Father who was in heaven loved me dearly and would look after me for always. He knew all that I needed, all that I wished for and he answered my prayers quickly with little delay. My love for Jesus continued to grow. My faith became stronger. I became a follower of Jesus.",
                "3. I moved into Standard Two in 1934 and the Lord showed my heavenly body to me. The Lord Jesus Christ appeared to me twice in his own person; He was almost real to life. It happened as I was asleep. I was flanked by two angelic figures. We were all clad in long white cloaks and our bodies were as bright as the full moon. We seemed to float up and down in the air. We were in a temple. We were singing Hymn 124 in the Methodist hymn book, 1940s edition. We floated northwards and southwards. Our hearts were filled with joy and immense pleasure as we were singing to the supreme being beyond the demiurge, to the Almighty God.",
                "4. I had a dream that I was on top of a mountain. I was shown a small plot fenced with wooden poles. The plot lay barren. It seemed to be autumn. I moved onto a very high rock. I turned east and saw lush green trees. Above all the growth and standing on a rock beneath the trees were a group of African men dressed in long white gowns. They were singing praises to God. A voice said to me, \"Behold the Apostles of Jesus\". As I looked towards the rock, turning slightly to the south, I saw the Lord Jesus sitting inside the rock itself. He held a large book which was open. He was reading from it. His face was raised and faced north. On seeing Him I said, \"A! Lord!\" and I began to descend from this rocky height. I awoke enveloped by the Holy Spirit.",
                "5. In this same year I had another vision where the Lord, Jesus appeared to me once again. I was sent to preach the Word of God to a land in the west. (Read Isaiah 6:1). I arrived at a village where people huddled in a four-cornered church building were singing, playing drums and dancing. I entered the hut, sat near the door, and quietly watched and listened to them. When the singing and dancing had stopped, I stood up and addressed all present.",
                "\"Gentlemen, when I came into this church I heard all that was said and saw all that you did. I come from the East, and I have been sent to preach the Word of God to you. I will not preach in this room, but please let us all move out in the open.\"",
                "They all began to stream outside and formed a human cordon which barred my exit. I came out as far as the door, and standing there, I began to preach the Word of God. These strange people hurriedly picked up stones and moved menacingly toward me saying, \"You have come to convert the world! You have come to convert the world! We will stone you to death!\"",
                "My body was immediately sucked into the earth. I travelled as if in a tunnel under ground and came out alongside a river flowing from the east to the west, with its banks covered in green grass and dark willowy trees. I went down on my knees to pray facing east. In front of me was a small hill covered with attractive trees and green grass.",
                "When I had finished praying, I stood up and murmured to myself, \"How am I to get back home since I left my bicycle behind when I fled from the mob of attacking villagers?\" A thought came to me; \"Hoo indeed, I shall have to fly”. . . and fly I did heading east whence I had come. I came to land on a river bank. The river flowed from north to south. Further upstream across the river toward the east was a field with a rich green maize crop ready to flower.",
                "There was a spring close by the river, with very clean water. I crouched to have a drink and, to my amazement, the Lord Jesus Himself was sitting in the spring. He again had a book opened before him. He was again looking north. I said, \"Oh Lord!\". I turned and headed for home. I woke up overcome by the Holy Spirit.",
                "6. The Lord Jesus answered my prayers once more in 1934. I prayed to Jesus saying, \"Lord you are my father, I have no guardian on this earth besides yourself. Now, 1 934 is come to a close, Masvaure School has no Standard III, the nearest place would be Kwenda. Father, may I please have enough money to go to Kwenda for Standard III next year in 1935?\" I heard the voice of the Almighty God say almost immediately, \"You shall go…\"",
                "I got up and quickly rushed to the Evangelist Patsika at Masvaure and I said to him. \"Please school leader, add my name to the list of pupils going to Kwenda next year as I too shall go because it is now the will of God.\" The evangelist stared at me in surprise and said \"A! Mamvura! You say you too will go to Kwenda? Where will you find the school fees?\" I replied confidently, \"I shall find the money.\" I left and headed straight for the nearby thicket to thank my father in Heaven in prayer, saying, \"Father, I thank you for promising to send me to school at Kwenda next year. Your compassion is considerable. My dear Father, I shall honour you and praise you many many times\".",
                "As I arrived home early that evening, Amai Saramina called out,“Nhai Mamvura! did you know that a long time ago before your father died, Taga owed him a cow. We should perhaps talk to him. He might repay us with another beast. We will surely have the money for you to proceed with your education next year. This man Taga took ‘Mutiunamauswa” (the grass of the tree) your father’s cow which was heavy with calf. So if he agrees he might give us a cow with its young one.”",
                "My mother and I left for Taga’s home. Taga did not argue but meekly gave us a cow with its calf.",
                "I left for the bushes to pray and give thanks to God with tears flooding my cheeks. We sold the cow and had enough money for me to attend school at Kwenda Mission in 1935.",
                "7. When I got to Kwenda Mission, the Evangelist, Isaac Patsanza was kind enough to provide me with free lodgings. I found a solitary spot behind his homestead which became my secret and regular place of private worship. I would leave for my home in Masvaure every Friday and spend the weekend with my mother, my younger brother Elijah and our sister Priscilla who attended the local junior school. My journey from Kwenda to Masvaure was always on foot. I strolled along in a deep and tearful conversation with my Father in heaven. The Spirit of Jehovah would fill my heart and I would sing to God the following hymns from the Methodist hymn book:- 127, 50, 124, 24, 30, 59, 62, 118, 34, 93, 33, 121, 142, 153, 42, 18, 2, 1, 52, 79, 135, 130, 11, 132, 95, 97, 137, 128, 88, 64, 125, 76, 63, 85, 54, 90, 126, 21, 96, 36, 80, 77, 25, 89, 10, 1 20, 98, 12, 147 and 101. The trek home through the veld would be in song and I would hardly meet any other living soul along the way.",
                "8. I performed abysmally in the midyear school tests in 1935. I failed arithmetic. I resumed the prayer session. One day I related my wish to Jehovah, \"Father, look, I did not do at all well in my Std. III at school. I ask you Father, please could you bestow upon me the mental capacity to overcome any problems at the end-of-year examinations. I wish to come first in every subject and to be top of my class ahead of everyone else.\"",
                "Come the time of the examinations I wiped the slate with a hundred percent pass rate in arithmetic. All the 50 answers were correct.",
                "I also came first in Standard III. I went to pray in gratitude and excitedly praised God saying, \"Father, most wonderful, I thank you deeply today, I also praise your Name many times for you have immense love. You came to my support and aided me to succeed in all my subjects, I came top of my class. I thank you Father.\"",
                "9. In 1936 I repeated my request to Jehovah to repeat the same feat and have me come out as the top pupil once again saying, \"God of all the love, please help me get to the senior school next year. I only have you Lord. So Father, please talk to Reverend Haworth who is here at Kwenda so that he may understand my plight and take it upon himself to send me to senior school. Furthermore Jehovah please, also, have a talk with the evangelist Isaac Patsanza who teaches here too so that he may feel sorry for me and wish for me to go to high school next year.” God answered this plea for support almost immediately. Toward the middle of that year, Mr Patsanza said to me, “Ernest, Reverend Haworth said he would like you to go to Waddilove to study to be an evangelist but I said no to him as I want you to go to Domboshava so that you can study up to Std. VII. You will understand that I felt it correct to turn down the notion of you going to Waddilove as you would study only as far as Std. V. You would be sent immediately afterwards to work and preach in the field.”",
                "I agreed with him and thanked him for his stand against a speedy process. I went to pray to Jehovah saying to God, “I thank you Father, for you were quick to enter into the hearts of Mr Haworth and Mr Patsanza and make them send me to school as is my wish. Father, when I have completed my education, I shall preach the Gospel of your Son Jesus Christ in Africa.”",
                "I completed my Std. IV by coming top of the class once again and went to the forest as usual to praise and thank the Lord God saying, “Oh God you are the most high. You always respond to the prayers of your people, today again I praise your Name. I honour you Lord for you have again come to my assistance to ensure that I succeed in all my subjects at school...”",
                "10. “I place all my faith and trust in you Father of all love. I shall honour you and pray to you for the rest of my life. I shall praise your holy name Jehovah for you are perfect in all your ways. You are the determined, the unshakable, you are of solid steel. You who are all encompassing, you criss-cross the world with your guardianship, rock of ages. Thank you Jehovah, my God now and forever. Amen.”",
                "I said to the evangelist Patsanza, “Teacher, the year had come to an end, and I have completed all the schooling that is possible here at Kwenda. This means that, God, willing, next year in 1937, I shall proceed to attend senior school so you should, as my teacher please go ahead and write to Domboshava requesting that they reserve a place for me as you suggested.",
                "I, on my part, shall proceed with a visit to my sister this December. My in-laws in Chirumanzu still owe the bride price. I might sell a few cattle pledged as lobola and manage to raise school fees for next year. However, if all else fails, I shall come to you and take you up on your promise to assist me.”",
                "11. I left for Chirumanzu, collected and sold the head of cattle paid to my family as lobola for my sister. I raised enough money to pay all my fees and buy some clothes for myself. As I walked alone in the bush on my way home I kept talking to God.",
                "I was not frightened of the dark forest even though I was too young to travel by myself. Jehovah was with me all the while. I would sing to myself as I walked;",
                "The Shepherd is the Lord\nHe has looked after me,\nI will want for nothing\nFor I have faith in Him.",
                "There are green pastures\nWill I not graze upon them,\nWhere I shall sleep and partake\nWithout fear.",
                "The Holy Spirit shall raise back to life\nSo shall I be saved,\nTo attain perfect peace\nBy the Shepherd.",
                "When I walk in darkness,\nI fear for nothing\nFor you are with me\nYou fill me with joy.",
                "I have the Holy communion\nAhead of those who hate me\nHoly myrrh anointed my head\nI shall not want for anything.",
                "I thrive on the mercy and compassion\nThat is with me for always\nIn the house of Jehovah\nWho is for everlasting.",
                "12. On my return I turned into Kwenda Mission to see. Pastor Patsanza, “Teacher, I managed to raise enough funds for a full school year.” “That is good but I received a response from Domboshava who say they have no place for you. I did write to Howard Institute who said you might get a place. You should now prepare to leave and be at Howard in January when school begins.”",
                "I said, “Thank you teacher, I shall do as you suggest in the Name of God.”",
                "13. My heart was filled with joy at this good news and I rushed to express my appreciation to God in prayer saying, “Father, may I say thank you to you once again today for you found a school place for me at Howard. Please Lord guide me so that it will be possible for me to leave for school next year.” I broke into song still on my knees;",
                "Lead me God\nI am a traveller my Lord\nYou have all the power, I have none\nWhen I lose my strength\n0, Saviour\nYou are my shield.\nYou are my Saviour.",
                "14. As I sang to myself, my heart was filled with immense heavenly joy during this song. I lay asleep that night; I had a dream in which all of the Howard Institute was revealed to me. I also saw myself at prayer in Howard Hall."

            subtitle: "HE IS BESTOWED WITH BLESSINGS BY JEHOVAH WHILE AT HOWARD INSTITUTE 1937-1940",
            content: [
                "I left Kwenda for Howard Institute with all my worldly belongings rolled in a bundle I ported on my head. We walked for two days and nights before arriving in the city of the then Salisbury which is now Harare, the capital of Zimbabwe. This was my first time to enter into this europeanised white man’s domain. We left Harare by train and arrived at Glendale station. We walked for the remainder of the journey, twelve miles to Howard, the Salvation Army institute. The train journey we took during the rainy season was the first for me, it was an exciting experience for a rural boy from the village.",
                "2. My heart beat fast with excitement as we arrived into the grounds of the Institute, the site of the highest education. “Here I am. I have entered the home I yearned for and hoped to study at. The home I saw first in a dream. Howard I have come to you, home of the best education.” I prayed silently in praise to God through the night saying, “Thank you my Father for bringing me to Howard the home of the high level learning which I had thirsted for. May the Name of the Father, the Son and the Holy Spirit be praised, Amen.”",
                "We paid our school fees and necessary dues early the following morning and were allocated accommodation in the various dormitories. I attended my first early morning prayer meeting together with the largest number of young men and women, the most I had ever seen before. The institute had the largest number of white teachers both men and women. It was all very exciting, especially the beautiful music sang in English in praise of Jehovah the Almighty. Some of the young girls helped the rhythm by tampering choiristically on tambourines. The rest, including all the boys and men clapped their hands when the choruses of the hymns were sung. It all sounded so very wonderful.",
                "Major Tabor was in charge of the institute, with Major Lewis as headmaster. Our teacher in Std. V was a white lady, Adj. Dolman. Our classrooms were amazing in their construction, they looked beautiful both inside and out and were pleasing to my eye. I was happy and began to trek off into the thicket to pray alone.",
                "I praised God with the words; “Jehovah, Father, I am here now. I give thanks to you the Creator. May your name be praised for all time. Now my Father, please talk to the Head of the Institute, Mr Tabor and the Headteacher, Major Lewis so that they like me and that they feel sorry for me enough to pay for my school fees for next year. Look, the money I raised in Chirumanzu has met the costs for this year and there is none left. I believe that you can do this for me as you have always heard my pleas for help. You always answer my prayers. Oh Father, you please my soul with your love for me. You are an amazing God. I place my body and soul on your altar for the coming of the Gospel of your Son Jesus Christ to Africa. Amen.” I broke into song in praise of the Lord of Lords;",
                "I come to Jesus\nHe makes me joyous\nHe has pity on me\nIn times of trouble.\n\nI come to Jesus\nI shall be happy\nHe calls out to me\nThe young like me.\n\nI come to Jesus\nHe hears me out\nHe loves me greatly\nHe comes to my aid.\n\nI come to Jesus\nHe who helps me\nHe can lead me\nTo His world.",
                "There in Heaven\nI shall be holy\nI shall look upon Jesus\nMy Saviour.",
                "Jehovah was quick to respond to this prayer in that same year in 1937. Both Major Tabor and Major Lewis became very fond of me. While still quite fresh behind the ears, I was made one of the school prefects. I got on well with all the teachers who all seemed to like me a lot. My responsibilities as a student grew. I would read the Bible for the English-speaking preachers during the Sunday services. I would often carry out simultaneous translations from English to Shona and vice versa for the benefit of none Shona-speaking preachers. Everytime I conducted myself humbly and carried out my duty totally entranced with the Holy Spirit.",
                "4. One day I was surprised to be called into the office of the Headmaster, Major Lewis. I found him sitting with two school inspectors, Messrs Mertha and Smith. Once inside the room, I felt overwhelmed to be in the presence of men who represented the great heights of education. Major Lewis noticed my uneasiness and kindly said, “Don’t fear son, look, these two gentlemen are inspectors who have come to discuss how you can be awarded a bursary from the Alfred Beit Trust.",
                "“If you are lucky to win it, you will earn $11.00 per year which breaks down as, $2.00 pocket money to use as you will: $9.00 for school fees until the end of your school days. The gentlemen have brought papers for you to sign to enable you to receive this scholarship, God, willing.”",
                "One of the men asked me for my father’s and my name and my personal national registration card number, the district I came from, and a few other related details.",
                "Major Lewis said at the end of the question and answer session, “That is all. So they will let you know if you are lucky to get the bursary next year in 1 938 when you get back from the school holidays. You can go now child.”",
                "I left the headmaster’s office and headed for my private spot among the rocks. I prayed. “Father, I have seen what has been done. You are still with me. In you is found everything, my rock. You are my everything in everything. My God who strives tirelessly for the widowed and the orphaned. It is within you that the ashen faced are transformed to look spritened with a rich olive complexion. God you are my roof that has today calmed the pangs of my heart. You are the heaven of truth. What you possess, you have allowed me to own today and all that I own also belongs to you I say. You and I are one, Father, I am nothing if you are not with me. You are my life, my Jehovah, who garners for me in the heavens. It is not you yourself alone? You are the rock from which I come, be with me always - Amen.”",
                "5. I joined some school boys to begin a choir for church songs; Aggripa Mapele, Leman Dani and Samuel Dune, among others got together to practice service hymns.",
                "We would practice in the church and as we improved, the preachers would make special requests to us to sing as they related the words of the Gospel of Christ. They would ask especially for the hymns strong on the Holy Spirit. Our clear youthful voices would produce a bright and serene sound that moved most people in the congregation as we sang within the spirit of Jesus Christ our Lord. It happened that we were called upon most Sundays to sing for Jesus in the house of God. I felt that God was indeed pleased with our efforts.",
                "I won the school’s own bursary in 1937 which was $5.00. The headmaster suggested that I hold on to it, “Look child, you will keep this $5.00 note until the year end. If you do happen to win the Beit Scholarship as well in early 1938 you will surrender the $5.00 to whoever comes second to you in Std.V.",
                "I agreed that it was fair for me to do so. I praised God as always. Schools closed and we all spread out to our different villages.",
                "I spent my holiday with my family and one day attended a village wedding. Two locals, Titus Mharapara and Nelly Muzengi were getting married. I was vividly surprised when Gamarieri Gwena a well to do gentleman by local standards said to me, “Young man, I know that you have precious little to call your own and that you attend high school. Come to my home tonight after the wedding party. I have a jacket and a pair of trousers that I wish to give to you. I have many smart suits I bought myself in Shabani. Don’t fail to come.”",
                "I said to him, “I shall come. I thank you.” I passed by Gwena’s house and collected the suit and proceeded to give thanks to Jehovah, He who clothes those with naked bodies, I thanked Him greatly.",
                "6. 1938 was a year of many blessings for me at Howard Institute. I attained the Beit Trust Scholarship of $11.00 and the supplementary $2.00 pocket money. A senior relation of the family, Hugo Mache, send me some money which I used to buy a brand new bicycle. I came first in the class in Std. VI and received a pocket watch as a prize. If I had not received the bursary from the Beit Trust, I would still have won the $5.00 Scholarship floated at the school. I thanked God even more concertedly. I continued with my private errands of prayer into the high growth.",
                "One day, towards dawn while asleep in the dormitory, I heard a voice say to me, “Paul, Paul, wake up and let us pray, Paul wake up to pray.” I opened my eyes expecting to see a fellow schoolboy near my bed. I noticed to my alarm that nobody else but me was awake in the room. I woke everyone up asking if anyone of them had called me from my sleep. They all denied my allegation and said, “No.” I knew then that it was God who had summoned me to pray. We all got out of our beds and knelt to pray to God I likened this to God’s call in 1 Samuel 3:1-11. One of my roommates was Luke Chidavaenzi who I had come across in the nearby forest praying among the rocks. I saw him as I approached my private spot of prayer and startled him saying, “What are you doing in the forest?” He responded saying, “I come here to pray to God.” I continued, “Me too. This has always been my place of prayer where I pray to God ever since.” It happened then that from that day in 1938 and for all the time I stayed at the institute, including the period I returned to teach at the place, Luke and I always prayed together until 1940. I understand that Mr Luke Chidavaenzi is today a member of the Apostolic Faith, a congregation based in South Africa. My God, Jehovah the Almighty had called me by name at Howard in 1938.",
                "7. The Holy Spirit provided me with divine assistance in all my study areas as a teacher trainee. Each time we were about to sit for a particular paper I would hum to myself a church song or whistle softly as we mingled around on the step before entering the examination room. The Holy Spirit would envelope me and I would lighten with inward joy and all would be bright and accessible. My mind would whiz through texts and cover all we had learned in a brief moment. As we entered the room and looked at the question sheet I would write all my answers through the torch-light of the Holy Spirit. These experiences made for me to always come first in class thereafter until I left the institute.",
                "In my four-year stay at Howard as a scholar I got on well with everyone and received exceeding respect from all I met, worked, studied and lived with at the institute, the African and white teachers, the young men and women. I take no credit for this glowing experience but give to God who was with me in all the while. I alone went to my spot in 1940 after my final examinations and praised Jehovah starting in song;",
                "The good covenant\nThat was granted by God\nTo the wary traveller\nI shall lead you always.\n\nI shall lead you, I shall lead you\nI shall lead you with mine own eyes\nAll the way that leads to heaven\nI promise I shall lead you.",
                "8. I knelt and asked Jehovah, “God Almighty, Creator of heaven and earth, harbinger of all that is in heaven and on earth, I thank you always for your profound leadership of all who have faith in you. Father of all races, God who does not discriminate, you educated me, an orphan, indeed I have a parent in you. Lord, you are my rock, it is in you that I find solace.",
                "“Look Jehovah, today my heart is at peace. You have satisfied my soul. I am grateful. You granted me the schooling I begged of you. A! God you satisfy the needy unsparingly. You are my roof, I love you God. You are my song Jehovah. You give pleasure to my spirit. So may your Name be praised today, the originator, the eternal, the omnipotent, omniscient, omnipresent, rock of ages, mighty and immovable, solid as steel, the weaved web that binds the earth together. Now please send me to do your work as I am about to leave soon.”",
                "The Lord spoke to me with His own voice saying, “Look, I am with you for always to the end of your road. Fear not, Look I am with you.”",
                "9. In the middle of 1940 toward the end of my teacher-training studies, the Lord Jesus revealed to me how Africa was to be recreated. I wrote to a local publication, the “Bantu Mirror” and it was published worldwide. They said they would follow up the development to monitor the likelihood of the related events coming true.

            content: [
                "In December 1940, I was sent to teach at Gwese, three miles from the Howard Institute. In that month, the white Reverends took me by motor car and left me at this school which was almost closing down. There was no house to live in. The place was almost desolate in more ways than one. The unmarried teachers’ residence was wrecked. There were no children’s classrooms. The total enrolment was only 25 and they used the church building for classes. When the Howard fathers had left I picked up my baggage and went to stay temporarily with the Agricultural Instructor, Mr Noah Chivizhe who lived near the school.",
                "I asked Mr Noah Chivizhe if I could prepare my own accommodation at the school while I stayed with him. He agreed and I stayed with him for the whole of December. One day I was haunted by the idea of leaving the school because of the hardships I were facing. I left Mr Noah Chivizhe’s house to talk to the Preacher and I said to him, “Look here man of God, I was left here by church reverends yesterday on Sunday so that I could teach, but there is no room to stay, not even a courtesy lodge.”",
                "He responded saying, ‘Yes teacher, there is no accommodation here, the house that the former teacher, Mr Hondoyedzornba lived in was dilapidated. There is however a small hut we had begun to build, but it has no room yet as you saw yourself when you arrived.",
                "I said, “That is alright Preacher, but look we must thatch it quickly because I have nowhere at all to stay. Do you know that I am staying with the Land Demonstrator, Noah Chivizhe on a short term basis?",
                "We went into the bush to strip bark off the trees to use as rope and began to put up the roof of the little room. Toward sunset the preacher left for his house while I proceeded to Chivizhe. The following morning I set off again to attach the roof. I did not have anyone to assist me. I had to carry the thatch bundles up to the roof first and then climb up to do the thatch. I did this all morning.",
                "While working on the roof, I ran out of rope and with nobody to assist me, I started to think,” But what is it that I am suffering for? Some of my colleagues were sent to schools with a descent accommodation. Others received placements at Howard Institute itself. I had to be dumped here at this ruin, and made to build my own classrooms. It is as though I came here to engage in some type of house thatching piece work. Was it not I who completed a Teacher Training Course and performed far better than anyone else? Did I not come top of my group?”",
                "“Reverend Howarth would really like me to join him as one of the teachers at Kwenda Mission. Better that, than to have to spend days of suffering like this? I have to climb down for thatch and rope, and come up the roof several times loaded with grass and bark-rope! Why must I suffer so much, and for what gain?”",
                "These thoughts passed through my mind as I worked on the roof. Words of heaven which I had learnt by heart quickly came into my heart and I said to myself, “The Spirit of the Lord is upon me, Because He has anointed me to preach good news to the poor. He has sent me to proclaim the freedom of the captives and restoration of sight to the blind, to set at liberty those who are oppressed, to proclaim the acceptable year of the Lord.",
                "A! My heart began to fill with joy and an amazing peace. I said, “These are the poor, to whom I should preach the words of heaven.”",
                "I prayed saying, “Look Father, I am here to do as you wish. My God, strengthen me so that I will not be shaken by anything of any kind. I give you my body and my heart, to use them in your work, of saving your people, the poor and the blind of Africa, Amen.”",
                "I began to descend from the roof top to fetch some more thatch and rope and climbed up to work on the roof. I had a new found energy and worked tirelessly. I completed the thatching and started to live in this small room alone.",
                "I embarked on a programme of moving among the villagers talking to parents and children at each homestead explaining to them the advantages of education and the goodness that is in God. In God’s amazing glory, I called a meeting with the parents, and enrolled 160 children to start school, as compared to 25 pupils when I arrived.",
                "I rushed with the news to Howard Institute and told the Reverend-General. He said, “That is very good, I shall provide you with two or more teachers. One of them is George Makuzva who is from Kwenda. He will be here soon. I shall therefore send him to you. Jeremiah Marufu from Gweshe, who has just completed his studies here at Howard, shall be the other one.” I thanked him and left for my school. When George Makuzva came, we moved through the villages together preaching the Gospel of Jesus. We used to sing Wesleyan hymns and many people would gather round and we would preach the Word of God to them amidst tears.",
                "It came to pass therefore that many men and women, boys and girls, turned to Jesus. The hymn we would sing during these sessions is one in the old Methodist Shona hymn book*",
                "Mumhanzi uri kudenga\nKana kozoridzwa iwo,\nNokuriridza kukuru,\nKana kozonzwikwa iko,\nKuparure namakuva,\nKutsemure napanyika.\n\nNegungwa rinovabisa\nIvavo varakamedza;\nNenyika inovabisa\nVose vakanga vavigwa;\nVamukire pano rufu,\nVanoenda pakutongwa.\n\nVati ivo vakafire\nPane zvakaipa zvavo,\nNenguva yavanoona\nIchocho chityiso chavo;\n\nVawe vose pane gomba\nVakandirwe pano moto.\nNdivo vakanaka voga,\nVanopona noyo musi;\n\nNdavakatongerwa voga,\nVanozopinda kudenga\nVaine mibayiro yavo,\nVaina M’ponisi wavo.",
                "A lot of people began to fill the house of God each Sunday. They would come to listen to the songs of the Holy Spirit and the Gospel of Christ. December holidays of 1940 came and went and we entered 1941. When we opened school for the year, more children enrolled to bring the number to 196 and Jeremiah Marufu arrived to join us. The school now had four classes, Sub A, Sub B, Std. I and Std. II.",
                "At the beginning of 1941 I experienced the immense power of God. This is how it happened. I was visited by Mr and Mrs Sinamano of Epworth Mission who were on their way to visit their son at a school within the Chiweshe reserve.",
                "Whilst we sat chatting, we began to talk about God. The Sinamanos related to me work on the Gospel of Christ that Evangelist Marwodzi was doing. As time wore on, I felt cramped by the power of God as one trapped in a mouse cage as they, the two spoke about salvation. I spent the whole week enveloped by the Holy Spirit.",
                "I would go into the Church building and the place would become mightily reverential. When people came to pray, they would feel that they were in the house of the Lord. The congregation would profoundly sing praises to God. I would preach the word of God in heaven above, people would come to the front and fall heavily to the ground, those who were jinxed with evil spirits would be excocised. People would tear off their clothes when overcome by violent demons with evil spirits escaping from them after giving themselves up to, and turning to the Word of God. All those people who were saved remained in the congregation of the Lord for all the time I stayed at this place.",
                "It would happen often when I was taken over by the power of God that I would talk as though I was God himself. Some people thought I had lost my senses and was most probably mad. These occurrences are similar to the events of the day of Pentecost (Acts 2:12-16). So it happened that the people summoned Andrew Midzi, the senior land demonstrator from Rosa. This man was originally from Kwenda. They said to him, “Come and see what is happening to your friend here. Mwazha the teacher has gone mad. He says he is the Lord everytime the Holy Spirit is on him.”",
                "Mr Midzi called on me one day after school toward sunset and found me filled with the Spirit of God. He discussed the scriptures with me and found that I did speak as though I was God Himself. He vehemently showed that there was no way possible for one to speak as if they were God, he said, “No, it is not possible for a mortal person to be God. You are Mwazha but it is only that the power of God is now increased within you.” He left. I remained engulfed by the Spirit. My voice became deeper and my knowledge and love of God grew increasingly inside me. The days that followed witnessed more people who came and turned to worship God after giving up their wayward habits.",
                "6. In 1941, the Easter period at Gweshe, in Chiweshe, Mazowe District, was a week filled with the fame of God. We would go into the church everyday from dusk to dawn. On Easter eve, the congregation received immense powers of God. Many who were ill and infirm were healed and those bound in evil spirits were relieved of them.",
                "Church leaders of the Howard Institute were amazed at these wonders and said, “Let us pray for Mwazha the teacher so that God may fight for him and he can overcome temptation for the work that the Lord has given him to do is a huge task.” This began the practice by followers everywhere who would mention me in their prayers.",
                "The good year with the Lord came to an end and 1942 began. We opened the new school we had built in the crop fields. The school now had 250 pupils and five teachers. The school now went up to the third grade. In this year, the Spirit of the Lord busily converted many people. During Easter of the same year, an angel of the Lord came to me saying, “**Child, do you want personal wealth?**” I said, “No, I would rather have the church instead of wealth, so that I may build the Church of Christ.” The angel proceeded to grant this gift of riches to my younger brother Elijah, (1 Kings 5:5-12).",
                "7. In that same year, I had a dream whence God showed me multitudes of would-be followers of my way of worship dressed in white cassocks. These people were singing from hymn books they held and were filing northwards. I was to their right as I walked alongside them and we took over a large building from whence gunshots were aimed at us but failed to hit anyone of the marchers. At the end of that year, I was instructed to move back to Howard C.P.S."

                "Toward the end of the year in 1942, God showed me a vision from the rock of how I was to progress in my evangelical crusade.",
                "I was at the top of the mountain which had a decorative rock that spiralied heavenward. I was placed high upon the topmost point of the pillar in the sky, from where I shouted out, **“Aleluah, For God omnipotent reigns!”**",
                "While at Howard in 1943, God sent me another vision to summon me for the evangelical work of His Son Jesus. Two angels descended into my room as I lay asleep one night. Each held a golden vase filled with the most lovely flowers.",
                "One angel stood at my head and the other at my feet. My body was floating. The angels looked at me as each one presented its vase to me. The angels gazed at me for a long moment. Afterwards I knelt and prayed, **“My Father, let it be as you wish, for I am yours forever and you are mine - Amen.”**",
                "2. In 1944, the Lord strengthened my resolve: He made me forever fearless irrespective of who it might be or what I may face, but should have faith in Him, He that is my rock. I saw two men, who were enemies creep toward me as I lay asleep that night. They wanted to hurt me. I moved eastward. They followed behind me. I crossed a small river heading for a village nearby. The two also crossed the river in pursuit.",
                "At this point, a large golden bowl descended from above and landed just in front of me. A hand as bright as the setting sun came from above, grabbed me, lifted me up, and placed me in the bowl. The bowl sailed into the sky taking me to heaven. My two enemies came to where the bowl had been and looked skyward at me where I was now flying away. The dish swooped downward heading southward and landed on a very high and very large rock indeed.",
                "The two men, still far down below followed fast on foot and stopped when they got to the bottom of the rock. They looked up at me as the bowl lifted into the air taking me skyward toward the east until they were left far behind out of sight. I could not see them or the earth below. I prayed to God at the end of this vision expressing gratitude, **“I thank the heaven of heavens, the powerful hand, my bunker fortress, my rock. You are my escape route my Lord, now and forever more - Amen.”**",
                "3. In 1945 a prayer group outside of the Howard complex met to discuss ways of bringing about my demise, but the Lord once again came to my rescue.",
                "I had a vision where I entered the church in which these people were praying and as I walked outside, the worshippers gathered menacingly around me. As they picked up stones to attack me, a hand came from above and picked me up and zoomed off with me above the heavens. My would-be attackers could not find me thereafter.",
                "4. I expressed my gratitude again saying, **“May the glory and praise be in the right hand of the one with Almighty power. The hand that always grabs hold of me and comes to my rescue and fights for me when I am in danger. I also have faith that this, your hand, shall open the great doors leading me into a new life - Amen.”**",
                "5. In 1946 I saw our Lord Jesus Christ sitting on a cloud at the east. He was facing into this world as one travelling toward us. This is how it happened. A vision was revealed to show me in the middle of this country. It was then I noticed myself in the middle of a field ready for harvest infested by birds, wild and farm animals feasting on this ripened crop with nobody to rake it in. I was deeply touched by this sight. I exclaimed, “A! Why are people utterly without regard for such a crop that they leave it to perish?” Suddenly, I noticed two men sauntering eastward. The two strollers came by me standing in the field. I joined them. We ran off toward the east. We noticed our Lord Jesus Christ facing us from a distance. We increased our speed racing towards Him shouting, “May the Lord be praised. The King be praised.” He, who is the King of Kings remained sited on the cloud looking at us in His amazing beauty and in the almighty glory of his absolute power and the majestic elegance of his regal sovereignty.",
                "6. When this vision was over, I prayed saying, “**Praise be to the King, Jesus, He is the Lord of lords. May I appreciate the face of He, who receives me, He who loves me and He whom I shall worship for everlasting, His hand shall open grand avenues of a new life for me. I have now witnessed the glory of heaven the stellar that shines as brightly as the celestial morning star. You are my sun, the patron of all the people of the earth, God of gods. You, together with the Father, created heaven. The two of you engaged yourselves in the salvation of all the earth. I give my praises to thee. Lamb of God the Father, the allpowerful blood. You rescued us from evil. Greetings to you Jesus the King, the Star of Africa. A whole people greets you and acknowledges your Lordship. Welcome back Saviour, you have visited Africa. May the Holy Spirit come over Africa.**”",
                "While I was filled with the Holy Spirit I proceeded to pray:-",
                "**Africa, is your field Jesus,\nWhich is now ripe,\nBut with nobody to harvest;\nIt is left to animals to pluck;\nThese lost souls;\nOf those who love God,\nBut have no one to rake them in,\nJesus raise a messenger to us;\nTo garner fishers of souls of men,\nFor them to raise the spirit of those asleep,\nIn this your land;\nAfrica we await the gospel of the spirit,\nIn Africa your land Lord - Amen.**",
                "7. My first three children were born at Howard Institute. Their names came from the Lord.",
                "The eldest, Ngoni, meaning the grace of God, was born in June, 1944; the second, Kushamisa, the amazement of God, was born in June, 1946; and the third, Farai, joy in Christ, in October 1948. I left the Howard Practising School for Chideme in the Kwenda Circuit."

                "3. Lessons taken from the Bible often included verses from John 14:15-20, which quotes the Lord Jesus informing believers that those who love God show their devotion through obedience to His commandments. Jesus promises to mediate on behalf of those who have faith and who obey the dictates of God’s law. He is the visible proof of God’s existence and the world can accept Him as a tangible symbol of God’s presence, an existing likeness that is among the people. Jesus Christ is never likely to abandon us to the designs of the devil and will return to save us in a brief moment.",
                "His life form is clear to the believers who will attest that Jesus is God and one is the same as the other; the two are an indistinguishable intertwined and inseparable entity. This divine spirit is also in the believer, John 4:23-24. The sermons we gave had to acknowledge that the time of the future, the expected second coming of Jesus Christ was at hand. Those who had converted to the faith and had not only abandoned other detractions from their proximity to God but given themselves to the truth of prayer to the Father and worship God in the spirit would be saved. They are the very people that God has resolved to seek out and bring them closer to Himself. Worshippers sought out by God Himself and identified through their behaviour and practice of prayer are blessed in spirit and in truth.",
                "Acts 1:4-5 Jesus assembled his disciples and advised them not to leave Jerusalem but to exercise patience and await to receive God’s promise of the Holy Spirit which he had talked to them about. Jesus had mentioned that John, His forerunner had been baptised with water but these followers would be consecrated in the Holy Spirit in a time that would soon come to pass. Acts of the Apostles 2:1-42. The teaching imparts the proclamation that the messianic promises of God are fulfilled in Jesus and that through His saving work, the people were saved as well as reconstituted. This was the recreation made real and extended to all who have faith in Jesus because God as a matter of purpose vindicated and exalted his Messiah. Jesus is Lord. Our sermons would be interspaced with songs mainly from the old Methodist Hymn Book, 74, 52, 54, 125, 21, 71, 118, 121, 142 and others."

It Was close to the middle of the year that the Holy Spirit, which was the last utterance of Jesus on earth descended upon some participants in our prayer group and set to work among us. The arrival of the Holy Spirit signified a new era in our practice through its revelations and guidance. It became a priority to transform our approach to accept that God was to be venerated alone no other image could be placed next to the Creator of everything who was the source of justice and who could not be represented in any form.",

The connection of the dead to the living had to be dissipated by fire.",
                "The basic concept of worship that stood before and had been tolerated by white missionaries was now under attack. The Holy Spirit dictated that believers forsake the practices of witchcraft, wizardry and pagan sacrifices. We were actively calling for a way of life that was in line with the gospel’s expectation of the behaviour of those turned to Christ. We advised that worshippers desist from harking on and using magic portions in food and drink. The casting of spells was vehemently condemned and all these unsightly and unchristian materials were brought to church and burnt publicly for all to see.",

Many people would be overcome with uncontrollable shaking and would vibrate with evil and demonic spirits but on laying of hands on their heads, the writhing would cease and they would calm down and be at peace once the shaking stopped.",

Some were in need of the healing evangelism. Others came in curiosity and bewilderment as the miraculous cure of many illnesses was distinctly visible.

The Holy Spirit would safely shield these people from the start of our prayer sessions to dawn after which we would end. The atmosphere during the nights would be charged with an unusual sensation that brought a serene and attentive emotion on the worshippers. No one would fall asleep. As the preaching began, silence would be absolute and when we sang, the atmosphere would explode causing some people to lift their hands with tears gushing from their eyes. Tears streamed down my face as I was lost in the joy of the Holy Spirit and purity of its truth.",
                "2. Our sermon covered the time of the arrest of John the Baptist: Mark 1:14,15. Jesus had arrived in Galilee and related the Word of God saying the prophecy had been fulfilled. The Kingdom of God was close. It was time for people to repent and accept God’s Word. Members of our prayer sessions who gave in to the teaching would come forward to be made partakers of His Kingdom by giving up their past and seeking redemption and forgiveness that is just and without iniquity.",
                "Many witchdoctors brought their craft forward and confessed their sins. They burnt their wares in the fire for all to see. (Acts 19:18-20). The prayer meetings helped reveal the power of God and the intensity of its impact on those who turned to Christ. We tried to make it evident that God’s laws cannot be broken with impunity, but with God there is always room for repentance and a constant invitation to return to his love. God is morally and spiritually wedded to the people and treats them with justice, kindness and mercy. He protects them absolutely and people for their turn, must honour their side of the union by faithfulness, love and worship. The expected totality of effort must be toward avoidance of the whole tragedy which would clearly be one of unfaithfulness and disloyalty in the face of God’s unchanging love."

People gave up their way of life, their beliefs in medium spirits, magic portions, lucky charms and other practices passed down the ages were surrendered. The Holy Spirit would inherit these souls, the sick would be healed, the transformation was visible, the many often possessed by demonic spirits would be freed and all these sacrifices were not pleasing to the evil one - Satan.",
                "The new converts who came to Christ had the desire to let it be known to others that they had been sanctified and embalmed in the righteousness of Christ. So, word about these prayer groups spread, and not everyone was overjoyed at this development which certainly disturbed the norm. The conduct within the Methodist Church was disrupted, while those who were reluctant to allow the fulfillment of Christ’s indwelling spirit could not hold back their dread. They proceeded to relate a miscontortion of tales against us. They threw out as a mad notion that the Holy Spirit had brought a new teaching and instruction on how to conduct worship. These church leaders approached the African reverend at Kwenda Mission and reported that a group of men were misguiding followers of Christ with teaching in utter contradiction to the Methodist ethos.",
                "The disgruntled elements were obviously people who had attended our meetings as they narrated in precise detail our practices of first; providing the opportunity for attendants to openly repent their sins; and have those who decide to join us bring all traditional and tribal images of worship to be burnt on an open fire; and secondly, the use of the Name of Jesus in casting out demons; the laying on of hands and that some members of the Methodist congregation were themselves speaking in tongues and taken over by the Holy Spirit.",
                "2. The reverend was further informed that the Mwazha group compelled people to spend all night in worship with their followers increasing daily in number. It was alleged that we would go through the villages at Methodist prayer meetings and missions with our new school of thought, our prophecies and our healing activities and we would leave those who came entranced, unable to resist and bound to us indefinitely.",
                "The perceived threat was that if the Mwazha group was to be left to do as it pleased the whole Methodist congregation would be taken over by these zealous apostolic worshippers.",
                "The informers suggested that the reason for briefing the priest was for him to report the matter in turn to the reverend who had the administrative power to quickly curb the trend before the new wave of worship overwhelmed the church and derailed the parishioners. The report was concluded by relating that, “... the Evangelist Mwazha at Sadza is the leader of these deeds...”",
                "The black parish leader took the story to his white superior. It was agreed that a case be placed before the Quarterly meeting at Chideme when all the leaders from the Kwenda Circuit would gather. When I heard these developments, I approached God and presented the matter to Him in the morning, evening and during the night.",
                "A revelation came to me through a vision. I was at the east and noticed a large building in the middle of the forest. I entered this building and came into a great hall full of white people seated with hymn books in their hands singing praises to God in the most captivating tunes. Their eyes sank into the words before them but their hearts, filled with the joy of the indwelling Holy Spirit looked heavenward to God. I proceeded to an inner room and opened the door to let myself in and found even more people like those in the first room also engrossed in songs of praise. The third room I went into was exactly the same as the other two.",
                "I exited through another door and realised that I had come through the northern entrance into the first room and had left the building through an exit facing eastward.",
                "I left the building and went to sit near large musasa trees which were to the west and realised that I sat with another man on my left who was not known to me. I noticed another man standing further left holding a closed large book in his right hand. I asked him languidly, “Where do you come from?” He replied, “I come from Elber. I have come to teach you about the future”.",
                "I heard flapping of wings as he spoke and looked up to see a winged man come to land gently in front of us and reiterated the words of the first man saying, “The teaching that this man is about to relate to you was taught long before in the third heaven”.",
                "Taking in these words I turned west to the sound of two men driving their cattle towards us in a deliberate effort to stampede our discussion. I then looked southward and noticed a large pile of gold chains. The man from Elber stood up still clutching the voluminous book in his hands, and ran to pick up the chain, tied it round one of the musasa trees a short distance to the south and tied it to a similar tree that was to the north and said, “I have closed off the West”. The herd of cattle was deviated to run on either side of the chain toward the east with the two cattle drivers following behind.",
                "I woke up to kneel and pray facing east saying, “I pray to you O! God, Creator of Heaven and Earth, and all that is within, God Almighty your lordship can never be overcome. You answered my prayers when I needed you over the issue of the leaders of the church who had gathered to work out strategies to curb the teaching of your loyal servant Jesus. You, dear God, you sent me the man from Elber, you gave him the power to send off my attackers. I thank you that he did. He used the gold curtain to cordon off the west and the enemy was not able to shut off your message through Jesus in the gospel saying, ‘Preach the gospel, heal the sick, raise the dead and cleanse those with leprosy.",
                "Yes Father, the enemies of the cross of your son Jesus Christ were defeated by the man from Elber who came to me with the book of the lessons of the future which were witnessed by the one who flew from heaven above saying, The lessons that shall be taught here on earth have been taught before in the third heaven’. If you continue to fight for us, we shall go forward with your work God, now and forevermore, Amen.”",
                "5. I travelled to the Quarterly Meeting at Chideme with my colleagues, Chitedega, Dabwa and Govere. I gave them details of the vision I had. I explained how God had come to our defence with all his heavenly might. In allaying their fear, I assured them that we were unlikely to be deterred in serving God in the new mode that we had found.",
                "6. The meeting began with one of the African ministers saying, “Mr Chairman and all present, I have here a complaint from church seniors alleging that a group of men in our circuit are misguiding the Methodist followers through their teaching and methods of prayer. These men demand that people confess openly and publicly; they ask these people to place their hands on the heads of these people. They claim to release demonic spirits. I have it on good authority that some members of the Methodists who attend these sessions already have the power of the Holy Spirit come over them. I say very little and stop for now”. The meeting was requested to sit.",
                "7. The white man present, a Reverend Robinson, stood up and asked us all to open 1 Corinthians 12:1-11 and had one of us read to him. The passage read as follows, “Now concerning spiritual gifts, brethren, I would not have you ignorant. You know that when you were Gentiles you were drawn towards these dumb idols as if you were led.",
                "“Whereafter I give you to understand that no man speaking by the spirit of God who can say, “Jesus,” should be cursed as each is given to wisdom by the Holy Spirit and the knowledge that same Spirit. There are diversities of gifts, but the same Spirit, and there are also differences of administrations, but the same Lord. There are diversities of operations, but it is the same God who operates in all.",
                "“The manifestation of the Spirit is given by the Spirit the word of wisdom; to another the word of knowledge by the very same Spirit; to another faith by the same Spirit and to another the gifts of healing by the same spirit; to others the working of miracles; to another prophecy; to another discerning of Spirits; to another various kinds of tongues and to another the interpretation of tongues. But all these work from one source that selfsame Spirit which divides severally to everyone as each wishes”.",
                "8. Reverend Robinson stood up as chairman and said, “Did everyone fully understand the lesson read from Paul’s first letter to the Corinthians?”.Now, gentlemen let us not be jealous of each other. I would not want anyone to be disposed to envy... The Evangelist Mwazha and his lot have the gift of the Holy Spirit which is now manifest in them and through it they can heal, prophesy and induct people in the ways of God. I myself do not have such powers of healing. Mwazha cannot do the work of Superintendent that I do as Head Reverend in charge of the Circuit.",
                "“If there is anyone among you who wishes to heal through the laying of hands upon the sick then they should go ahead, but I warn you, you will develop leprosy. The laying of hands is taking place in England where church leaders at St Paul’s Chapel are healing the ill and infirm. The practice has also taken root in America where a great many people are benefitting from it.",
                "9. “I suggest that we grant these men support and provide them with written permits allowing them to continue with this good work which is mightily important in the eyes of God and of great value in all our parishes in this circuit”.",
                "The Quarterly Circuit Committee Meeting all raised their hands to agree unanimously to allow us to proceed with our prayer sessions and all that went with them. They resolved that “... it be as suggested”.",
                "10. The group I led was ecstatic - we were all pleased with these proceedings as we could now continue with the work of our Lord Jesus Christ in the manner revealed to us by the Holy Spirit. True to form, God had strived to have the gospel of his son Jesus preached in a manner he had decided upon and ensured that it would prevail.",
                "The Quarterly gathering ended amicably afterall and true to the vision, we left for our different villages. Each one deep in praise for the power of God that had glowed so vividly."

I thank you Father for by the grace of God my respect will come only from above and not from whatever else is upon me, my God, with abundant love, the Father who is always there for me. May you be praised, my refuge now and forever, Amen”.",
                "3. Our pastoral activity which involved extensive faith healing and preaching of the Word of God progressed at a rapid pace. The ill and infirm were brought to us from surrounding villages and experienced total healing by the grace of God.",
                "4. One day in 1953 I had a vision that showed me standing in the centre of this country. I sat on the porch of a deserted house facing east and after a short while, I began to wonder as a thought came to me, “Ah!, where would the owners of this beautiful house be?”",
                "5. “The homestead looks overgrown, there is no sign of life, one cannot imagine that anyone still lives here”. I said aloud, “Oh, I have chosen a deserted house. The owners must have died in this house”. I jerked myself to my feet, picked up my coat which I had slung nonchalantly on a clothes hook out in the verandah. I sped off heading northwards.",
                "I heard a booming voice shout after me from within the house, calling me back into the place I was fleeing from. I screamed back at the noise, “In the Name of the Lord Jesus shut up!” The voice died down suddenly. I found myself driving two large brown cattle yoked together pulling a magnificent chariot. I grew fond of these strong beasts with a gleaming hide which shone brightly, and their identical colour making them more appealing to look at.",
                "I drove these animals north, quite pleased with myself. I suddenly found myself in the east in a yard with a tiny hut that stood alone in the middle of the forest. While I stood in the clearing facing the hut. I turned west to face a very large and black coloured snake I had never seen before.",
                "This vicious looking amphibious limbless creature was very long and thick beyond imagination. The serpent was coming onto my patch and heading toward me. I turned to confront it, I was spoiling for a fight. I headed toward the snake. As I met the snake, the ground between me and the reptile became a large pit full of rubbish mostly dried grass which must have been from the clearing of the patch.",
                "6. The snake kept wriggling towards me swish-swashing over the straw in the pit ready to make its venomous strike. I stood there with nothing in my hands to defend myself. Two young boys emerged from nowhere to flank me. The snake raised its fused eyelids and its enormous head ready to strike at me. It heaved itself from the rubbish pit. The boy on my right handed me a knobkerrie. I raised the weapon with all my strength to smash the snake hard on its head before I collapsed at the feet of the youths.",
                "I felt weakened and dazed. The other boy on my left got hold of my legs and dragged me to the east. I began to regain my strength. As I gained composure, the youth on the right struck a match and lit the dry grass which burst into flame. I got up and grabbed the weapon again and whacked the snake once more. I killed it. The two youths who had come to my rescue disappeared into thin air. I never saw them again.",
                "7. I left this dreadful scene. I was flown east into a new land. As I flew high above I looked below and saw no living soul, no animal or bird was in sight but for beautifully lined cottages with lush green grass and leafy trees. The homesteads stood out amidst orchards with broad varieties of fruit but no one around to pick the fruit, no birds to pluck at the ripe harvest and no animal to graze in the grass.",
                "8. I wondered to myself, “Why is there no form of life in this land?” This world came to an end as I spoke. I came upon some mountains eastward and landed.",
                "I turned southeast before heading northeast. The path I followed headed heavenward. The gateway was wide enough to allow only my body to go through. I jumped into a cage from above which was elevated heavenward at speed. I found myself in a chateau with many rooms. The chateau was a grand building with a stateliness that I could not explain. I have never seen such a house on this earth. I stood in the middle of the rooms and looked north. The room had a closed door on each of the four walls. The doors faced northeast, northwest, southeast and southwest.",
                "9. I gazed at this splendor agape with amazement and noticed a treasure chest placed in front of me. A young white boy came in between the chest and I. He was adorned in a flowing white gown that covered him down to his toes. The lad started pacing the room beaming from cheek to cheek, certainly quite happy to see me there. He struck me as about five years old and looked bright clad in this snow white garment. I felt exhilarated too, like the boy.",
                "10. The north-eastern facing door opened and another white boy also around five years old walked into the room and headed toward me. This boy was also smiling but he wore a deep red gown that was dazzling to look at, I said to him bravely, “Ya, I know you. You are Danger”. With that I lunged at him viciously with my fists and hit him hard once. He fell to the floor dead. My joy returned.",
                "When I had killed Danger, the other little boy clad in white skipping around me quite pleased with himself and saying, “Now be careful, it will be a Giant next”.",
                "Immediately my sight left me. I could hardly see a thing. I said to God’s messenger, “A, I have all the strength to challenge and beat Giant, but alas, I cannot see a thing now”.",
                "I was brought down through the same harrow entrance I had used on my way up and found myself still high up but at the spot I had landed earlier. I flew back the way I had come flying over the empty lovely cottages, the beautiful orchards with varieties of fruits and flowers. I sensed the perfumery of the flowers below and noticed the fields neatly ploughed ready for the planting season.",
                "11. I came back across the dense forest that had no people, animals birds or insects. No living creature was visible here it was a lifeless jungle. I flew across a large river and came to ground in this world as we know it. I woke up and knelt to pray, “I thank you my God, the Expectant of the elect, you come to their rescue in times of strive. You God who does not deter from your gracious promises to those who turn to you. You have always stood by them from the beginning of creation saying, ‘I am with you, I will not desert you. I shall fight for you truly. Truly, truly I will come to your rescue’. I thank you Father for in the Name of Jesus Christ your servant, I diverted the evil spirit, overcame its challenge and shouted down its voice. You sent me reinforcements of two angels and with the power of Jesus we destroyed that terrifying mamba with its deadly venom.",
                "“Yes, with His infinite mercy toward me, I was escorted across places of astounding beauty and shown new lands until I was brought into the second heaven where I met and killed Danger with the help of your messenger. But I was brought down before I could destroy Giant because my sight had failed. So please God I come before you to ask for sight that would let me see Giant and the power to destroy him. Father, I have the power to fight Giant and defeat him but I have lost my sight. I cannot see Giant. Father please open my eyes so that forever I shall see.”"

            subtitle: "THE VISION OF THE BAPTISM OF ELIJAH AND THE SUBSEQUENT CONSECRATION INTO DIVINE SERVITUDE",
            content: [
                "1. 1954 was for me a year of intense prayer and self sacrifice. I surrendered myself to God and to the power of the Almighty. I reflected over all that God had done for me starting as far back as the day I had reached out in prayer and asked that He be my Father who art in heaven as mine had died when I was a boy. I noted through my observation that God’s association with me had enriched my life and would intensify my adherence to him through divine inspiration. I had sailed through school and college without significant hitch and had performed admirably in all I had engaged in. My outstanding performance which should be credited to God’s response to my requests put me in favourable stead with teachers and students alike. People from different walks of life including strangers noticed that I was a lad in need and took it upon themselves to provide me with what I needed especially money and often clothes to wear.",
                "God had inspired me to look to Him in gratitude and to express my adoration through prayers in the mornings and evenings every day. I had mellowed in perspective and imbibed in wisdom that I developed a profound respect for His son Jesus Christ. Inexplicable situations evaporated on appeal to God and in my daily routine I would overcome extreme situations which at times involved many a dangerous foe. My set of values had now been laced with my faith in the one God and His presence when I was in need.",
                "This approach helped me discern evil from good and inspired me to proclaim His power in and outside the classroom and, at meetings during my evangelical propagation of the gospel of Jesus Christ the Saviour. God had accorded me with the aura worthy of love and respect from most people I came into contact with. It was these reflections that softened my heart to God and made me respond in faith to his gratuitous call. I therefore took a walk to a quiet spot among the rocks, Sowe (in Shona) and knelt to pray facing east and looking skyward and said, “Like the bird, the water cook which detects water between tree branches and spouts its beak to the heaven, in anticipation, I too yearn for you in my heart God. I come to you now but words of gratitude fail me. I have no other way of expressing my appreciation. My Lord your attention to me Is amazing.",
                "2. “I ask you today Father that you anoint me your divine servant to serve in your household. Please receive my tattered sinful soul, and this earthly infested body for use as you will so that I become worthy to stand before you the almighty in your gleaming brightness and glory.",
                "“Lord, if it not be possible for me to be your loyal servant, then smite me dead today Father for my life would not be worthy and I would not wish for it if I cannot work as your servant in your household within the ambit of the gospel of your son Jesus Christ our Lord.”",
                "3. “I acknowledge that you have heard my plea to you Father. You answer my every prayer always through your infinite mercy which you rain on me everyday, I a sinner so grave and unholy, Amen.”",
                "4. I had a revelation that night which had me stand by a stone at the river edge. The river flowed from north to south and a voice from above said, “Dip yourself in this pool like all who served me before you.” I hesitated as the clear water made the pool look bottomless. I was struck by fear and woke up with fright.",
                "5. I knelt by my bed and continued, “I thank you my Father for you have requested that I be immersed in the baptismal pool of your servants who have stood by you. You do know that I did not plunge into the pool out of fear but because you willed it and it is your wish that I be free of dread of any kind? Please could you not extricate me from the bondage of fear so that I have the courage to dive into the water? May you take me to the same river tomorrow and give me the strength and chivalry to jump into the pool - Amen”.",
                "I spent a quiet day going through my usual routine and proceeded to my place of prayer toward sunset. I returned to bed and as I had wished, the revelation returned to me as the night before. I found myself at some place in the east walking toward and crossing a river. I continued and got to a trench which flowed from east to west. I bathed myself and the stream dried up before I could rinse myself! I woke up before I could rinse myself! I got up and immediately prayed, “Why Lord, what am I to you that you could be so offhanded to have me feel such embarrassment. I begged you for courage to dive into the river that your loyal servants have dipped in before but you place me in a trench with too little water to bath and it dries up so quickly.",
                "“My God, I am nothing to you but a worm and little else. Take my life God if you cannot have me serve you. I would be happy to leave this forsaken place if I cannot be your servant, for life would be utterly hopeless if you do not let me do little for you when you have been loving and have done so much for me that I can never be thankful enough. Father, please provide me with the tenacity and resolve to plunge into the water by your river again tomorrow Amen.”",
                "6. I went through my chores after sun-up and at dusk I set off again for my prayer spot - Sowe. That night, the revelation recurred and I found myself by the open water drain at the site where I had tried to bathe and the water dried up. I left this drain and walked westward again. As I approached the river crossing I felt a swish-swash under my feet and heard the thundering sound of a flooded river. I looked at my feet and noticed that my right leg treaded on a huge pipe delivering water from whence I had come and pouring gallons of it from under the bridge into the river. The river which I was about to cross flowed from north to south, I was trudging from east to west. I crossed the river and registered that it was now flooded down river. I woke up to pray thanking God wholeheartedly saying, “Father, I thank you, I have seen what you have done for me. You have the largest supply of water. It has flooded the river to capacity. I have faith and now am certain that come tomorrow I shall dive in like all those who have served you before me. Amen”.",
                "7. I began my day as always at school and in the home. I went to pray at sundown away from the homestead at the usual secluded place. I thanked God for His immeasurable love and mercy toward me and asked for courage that night when I would go to the rock by the riverside where I would launch myself off into the water.",
                "8. The revelation reappeared once more and I saw myself standing on the rock ready to dive into the pool. I sprang suddenly and plopped into the river feet first. I was now up to my neck in water. I tried to get my head under the water as well and was held back by fear as I was stuck with inaction. I saw two stars flash down from the sky and land on the left and right side of my head. I felt a burning sensation and sank into the water and stayed below for fourteen days. When I woke up with a wonderful sensation caused by my deliverance from fear and joyous emotion beyond compare I knelt before God and said,",
                "9. “Father, I have no words with which to express my gratitude to you for what you have done for me today. Your magnitude should be manifest in your show of love for people who belong to you. You are the almighty, you are the holy one, you are glorious in heaven and in all the lands of the living. Your power attends to those who strive for salvation through prayer to you day and night. You are the protector who through your mercy send your angels to our rescue and allow us to pass in safety from danger.",
                "“Father you are my life, my joy you are so good to me my God, I love you so. Why do you love the young and the impoverished, those scorned and abused such as I am? Ah, you came from heaven to this world to assist an unworthy canine like me my God? I concur. Oh! Father so please use me your loyal servant as you will. Badza guru kuwana murimi chiserima chakada murima, indeed; (a useful tool is in the hands of the smith for without an artisan the tool will be found wanting.",
                "“I know that I am of little value in your sight. How then can I do these grand tasks of preaching to your people, extending your grace to the converts through self-denying existence that brings forth fruit in the form of people who receive and accept the great truth? A truth brought by the gospel which is the atoning blood of your Son our Lord Jesus Christ you brought to us for our revival.",
                "10. “I present myself to you totally, for you to do with me as you will, for you came forth to assist me your servant to have the temerity to plunge into the pool that all your loyal servants before me dived in to be worthy of your cause, to serve you selflessly for always - Amen”."

There was a lot of excitement and activity as I saw some men singing but very boastfully in their movement and being proud of themselves.

Darkness, ignorance and iniquity of our objective and the source of our power would rouse the interloper who would dare engage the Holy Spirit in a contest that the divine power of the almighty would win convincingly.",

I have been up all night busy with evangelical work at Tendayi’s.” The motor drove toward Mudawarima for the meeting.

                "I did not retreat either and replied, “Reverend Wright, surely you know that I have always listened to you, - “tears began to cloud my eyes and I felt a deep sensation and became pitiful towards him -” But I am much happier listening to the Lord Jesus than to you Sir.” He could not hold back his anger and blurted out vehemently, “He-ee! So you say you do not obey any man above God?”",
                "I retained my composure and confirmed, “No, indeed I do not. The Lord who adorned you with the priesthood is the very same one who send me to spread the Word of God and relieve the ill and infirm of their troubles. I am here primarily to ensure salvation of God’s people.”",
                "A stony silence descended upon us for a long and uneasy moment, “I do not promise”, I said, breaking the silence, “I shall confer with the Lord first and hear what He has to say when he calls on us tonight.” He imposed his authority and said sarcastically, “Ya, Come to Kwenda on Monday and do tell us what the Lord will have said to you.”",
                "I said, “Fine”, He started the car and they drove off.",
                "4. I reported the incident to God that night making particular indication to the problem that I faced in carrying out my evangelical commission and spreading the Gospel of the Son of God, Jesus. I informed God that I had given myself up in order to endure whatever trials and tribulations that I would face in my crusade for the Lord Jesus Christ. I was prepared to opt out of employment and give up teaching all together. I would dedicate all my time and energy to abiding by the command of Jesus Christ.",
                "Doing so would not make me unhappy, my mind was made up. My calling was to lift people from the deprivation and mental slums of their existence to a purer mode of life endowed with redemption and the definite promise of eternal life enjoyed in the house of God. The only avenue open to me was to strive faithfully, tirelessly and devotedly for Christ. My life was to be the example of self-sacrifice which had to be reflected in my conduct - it was to be the example that all whom I spoke to were to follow. That battle had been fought and won with the shedding of the blood of Christ.",
                "5. The following day was a Sunday when I woke up. I summoned all the teachers at the school and told them of my tiffle with the white reverend. We had crossed swords and it was most probable that I would lose my teaching position. My fellow teachers were glum-faced as they took in this spate of news. My sermon that morning emphasized the importance of the Word of Jesus and everlasting Faith and obedience for always until death. Those lucky to have had the spiritual baptism were to guard against losing this priceless gift from above especially when they faced humiliation and were taunted by the devil incarnate who took many forms and could appear suddenly from nowhere. The road was bumpy and the journey more likely to be lonely and treacherous. Tests of endurance were going to be many.",
                "6. We left the church after the service. I was surprised to notice Reverend Manguni stand up from a back pew. He had been sitting through my lesson. I greeted him as we got outside and stood at the door. He said to me, “Let us go to your office”.",
                "We entered the room, sat down and he said, “Ya, Reverend Wright send me here. He asked if the Lord did come to you last night.” I said to him, “The Lord is still to send His word but do tell Reverend Wright that I shall be in Kwenda on Wednesday after school. I will pass by and see him whether I have received word from the Lord or not I shall talk to him. Please add that I said I will not give up what Christ Jesus send me here to do even if it means that I would be dismissed from my work as a teacher. I shall have my registration card* with me”.",
                "Reverend Manguni handed me a copy of the “Healing Home of South Africa” magazine on a faith healing clique based south across the Limpopo River”. He spoke, “Do you know that when I had fallen ill I only recovered after I had been to the Healing Home and they lay their hands on me? I must let you know that I have absolute faith in the teachings of Jesus Christ and the healing of the sick in His Name. I hazard to say that you have my support.”",
                "I merely said, “Is that so?”",
                "He proceeded meekly, “Of course. Can you permit me to take over your plan for the three o’clock service?” I said, “Indeed Reverend, be my guest”.",
                "7. Reverend Manguni flooded praise on the work we were carrying out when he spoke from the pulpit that afternoon. He reiterated the good deeds of the Lord that had taken place. I felt the warmth of his words and the confidence and comfort they yielded to me. The Holy Spirit came with greater assuredness over me.",
                "The registration card was used for employment record purpose. Every African had to hand it to the employer on being engaged for his stamp and or termination. Taking the paper with me indicated that I was ready to leave the church’s employment and follow Christ.",
                "After the service I walked up to my colleague, Reverend Manguni and shook his hand to congratulate and thank him, “Truly, the angel Christ came through you to give me strength and support”. I oozed with pleasure.",
                "8. I had a visionary dream that Monday night when I found myself in England at a spot in the north of that country. I saw the Lord Jesus Christ leading me as we walked heading north. We trekked along neatly planned paved foot-paths that cut through trimmed lush green lawns framed by flower beds with gorgeously set varieties of colours. We walked all the way up to Scotland. While we pattered on, I noticed a large gorge before us.",
                "I thought that the Lord who was in the lead would hesitate before he leaped across. I said to myself, “If it had been me in front, I would have had no trouble and bounced over easily.” The Lord Jesus stepped over the gorge. I had to leap over to keep up with Him. Jesus turned and retreated east. I stayed on His trail. I woke up and thanked God.",
                "9. The vision made it clear to me that Reverend Wright was not likely to deter my efforts at spreading the Word of Jesus Christ. I addressed all the teachers and school children at assembly that morning and assured them that I was not going to be asked to leave the school after all. “A!” They exclaimed, “Have you received written confirmation from the Reverend in charge?”",
                "I replied, “No, but the Lord visited us last night with a vision explaining that I had overcome the test.” Everyone beamed with joy after I had related the vision and let it be known that Jesus would come in His divine person to contend with those who dare upset his loyal servants determined to give up their all for Christ the Lord.",
                "10. On Wednesday after school, I grabbed my bicycle and pedalled off to my rendezvous at Kwenda. I saw Rev. Wright who also spotted me before I got to his office. He called out happily, “Oh! Mr Mwazha, come in.” He pulled a chair towards me and said, “Do sit down.” I accepted and sat down.",
                "This was the first time I had sat down, let alone been offered a sit in Mr Wright’s office. In the three years I have served under his tutelary I had never sat down to talk to him. The disparity of whatever nature that existed between us has been blatantly visible with him sitting behind his desk, and I standing before it for whatever length of time I was in the room.",
                "11. Rev. Wright promptly set off suggesting that I relate to him our work, “Tell me, how are you getting on with your faith healing?” I began from when we had started. I quoted verses from the Bible and holy passages on the teaching by Jesus. He took out an indexed copy of the Bible for easy reference of the scriptures. He said, “Would you like this Bible?",
                "I said gleefully, “Yes indeed.”",
                "He presented it to me saying, “It costs nine shillings.” I replied appreciatively, and took the book. “Yes.” He went on, “I do believe that the Lord Jesus commissioned you to spread the Word and heal the sick but cannot allow some of your group to carry out this type of work. I fear they might mislead the school children. I have no objections to you doing it because you are educated. You know, in England, people gather for this type of God’s work that one might imagine it to be a major conference. Their meetings are mostly carried out during the day on Saturday afternoons",
                "Why don’t you adopt that pattern and get together on Saturday afternoons rather than late at night? Do you realise that promiscuous girls may take advantage at night or marauders may provoke chaos and cause dangerous panic?” He sounded wary.",
                "I answered him, “Not at all. I do not think so. The Lord Himself is with us always and stays through the night during our meetings.” He said, “Is that so?”",
                "I jerked, “Of course. The power of the Lord binds all people. We can therefore carry out his work through the night until dawn without incident.”",
                "He wound down, “Fair enough then. Now let me in on the verses from the Bible that support you in the work of the Lord.” I transcended into a spiritual trance immediately and began to list the passages for his benefit;",
                "“Matthew 10:7, 8, 19;\nMatthew 28:18, 19, 20;\nMark 16:15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20.” I rendered.",
                "The Reverend resignantly said, “Please carry on with this work. I shall inform the church that you have permission to do this type of work. I shall also let the reverend at Chideme know that you can conduct prayers for the sick, undertake faith healing sessions wherever you may wish.”",
                "I thanked him and left his office elated and engulfed by the Holy Spirit. I rode back to Sadza praising God all the while. I praised God for He had once again send the Spirit of heaven to allow the will of Christ to take priority over all else. This was a landmark in our journey and proof that God had planned our path.",
                "No burden would be too great nor river too wide for God’s army would trammel all before it. The influence of God was limitless and the once antagonistic white leader had been mellowed and transformed into a supportive ally. God had won. The will of God had been done and the grace of Jesus could be freely expressed in all of the Charter District in Chivhu."

                "1. We had been granted necessary authority by Rev. Wright to enable us to heal the sick through the laying on of hands. We worked tirelessly and word of our endeavors spread far and wide. We had persevered. God had nabbed victory for the gospel crusaders. The onus was on us to diligently extend ourselves beyond our locality and spread this deformalised department of worship in earnest. We were to express in the minuscule way we could our appreciation of God's effort through us to cleanse the world of evil.",
                "Reverend Wright always mentioned us when he held a meeting of church leaders, \"Mwazha has the gift of healing. He is conducting faith-healing at Sadza and very sick people are recovering astoundingly in the Name of Jesus.\"",
                "\"One day, a Mr Canaan Bare who worked as a telephone attendant at a British South African Police Camp in Mvuma brought his sick wife to me. I prayed for her and she recovered.",
                "2. We later travelled to Zheke and a man rushed to us to plead that we visit his mother who was close to death with a strange illness. We got to the sick woman who was too weak to get up. We broke into song and prayed. I got up and called to the sick woman in a booming voice, \"In the Name of Jesus, get up!\" She sat up immediately. I repeated my call, \"Now, in the Name of Jesus, stand up\", and as she groggily got to her feet, shaking frightfully, I ordered her, \"In the Name of Jesus, walk!\"",
                "She staggered and falteringly moved on her feet away from me. I said, \"Come back\", and she did. \"Kneel.\" She got down on her knees, I placed my hands on her head and prayed for her to get better. We suggested that she be fed. She ate heartily. She was healed. The woman got up, \"I thank the Lord for Jesus has healed me.\" All the people of this area praised the Lord Jesus for the woman's miraculous recovery.",
                "3. The following day we were called to Sachipiri Irrigation Settlement where the daughter of the Evangelist Kurehwasekwa had been ill for some years. The daughter was asleep when we arrived. We broke into song and prayed. I said to her, \"Lord Jesus will make you well. So in the Name of Jesus, stand up!\" She was suddenly overcome by a demonic spirit instead. I advised the demon, \"In the Name of the Lord Jesus, get out of her!\"",
                "A devilish voice croaked out, \"Where should we go?\" as the girl writhed violently. I raised my voice and bellowed, \"Get out of her and go into the abyss of the earth and stay there.\"",
                "The force of the demon sprang the girl to her feet and rushed her outside the house and brought her to the ground before sapping out of her. The young girl got on her feet and joined our singing and clapping. She appeared as one back from a deep hypnotic trance. There was no trace or recollection in her manner of what had gone on before. She took the water pot and set off to fetch water from the well. When she got back, she prepared a meal for us all. We enjoyed the food as we praised God.",
                "4. Ezekiel Chitegeda and I moved on from the irrigation settlement and arrived at Magaisa to help revive his daughter-in-law who was unwell. I placed my hands on her and prayed. She was healed instantly in God's infinite knowledge of the human body. Our hands were conduits of the curative power of God who was never baffled by any disease. The miracles we performed were through Jesus Christ our Lord the healer as He Himself had stated."

This angelic power of rescue and cleansing occurred a large pool close to a water well within which I had seen Jesus in 1934.",
                "2. God had accorded me the power to use water to aide his people. I have since placed my index finger into water in the Name of My Lord Jesus to great healing effect. Worshippers drink it to allay pain, clean the blood stream or their intestines. The water has been a most effective symbol of the fight against other diseases such as asthma, diabetes, rheumatism, anaemia, anorexia, migraine, period pains, and post natal healing. The distinction of the serpents meant the absolute conquest of all illness and evil spirits through the use of the water. **The water is protection in homes when sprinkled sparingly in the home, or yard. It guards against evil spirits if kept in a small container in a safe place. One never need run out of it as it can be replenished regularly.**",

                "1. One Sunday afternoon around three o’clock, two men were sent to summon me to Masvaure. They said, “Mr Ben Masvaure sent us. He says his mother has been bed-ridden for two weeks now. She does not talk anymore and is now on the verge of death. Relatives and friends have gathered around from far and wide and are anxious to go back to their homes as the rains heralding the planting season have fallen. They should go back to their villages to work in their fields. If only this woman could get better. She is desperately holding on to life. We feel it better that she dies so that we can get on with other things. She has suffered enough.”",
                "I calmed the men down and said that they should, “Go and tell Mr Masvaure that I shall come after the church service in the late afternoon. I cannot promise to do as they ask. I shall ask God for two things firstly, that either the old lady recovers immediately, she must get up, talk coherently, walk unsupported and feed herself, or secondly, that she dies today. One of these two requests will surely happen today. Now gentlemen, lead on and I shall join you later.”",
                "The two men rushed off to Masvaure’s home. The church service began at three in the afternoon after which I set off to visit the dying woman. I chose a group of young men to accompany me including William Dune and Dhitoi Kepekepe. We trekked for five miles across the veld over the river by the pool where the Lord Jesus had instructed that I touch the water.",
                "Indeed, as the messengers had mentioned, a lot of people were gathered in vigil for the poor woman. The women had made a makeshift kitchen to prepare food for everyone. We entered the room to notice that the woman lay hopelessly unable to sit up, eat or talk. She looked far gone. There seemed little that anyone could do. I understood why everyone present felt it better for her to die and have her rest in peace.",
                "Some of the people mingling outside, came in to fill the hut, I spoke to them saying, “We come here in the Name of Jesus. We have two wishes to make to; our God in this room today. “May this helpless woman awake, talk, eat and walk or die now. Do you all; understand what I’ mean?” They accented and we sang;",

I was transiliently overcome by the Holy Spirit before placing my hand on the woman to pray and ask for God to heal the woman in the Name of Jesus and in his infinite love and mercy. I ordered her to get up in the Name of Jesus and she did. The woman shuffled toward the door and went out into the open. I called her back and although a little wobbly at the knees she came in and sat down. Our patient began to repeat the words I said to her before taking in some food.",
                "Everyone present was amazed, they looked bewildered, shaking their heads in wonder as they slowly accepted the plain truth and expression of God’s power that had taken place before them. The crowd had witnessed a miracle performed in the name of Jesus, it was the testimony of God’s word which exemplified the holiness and steadfast integrity that was available to inspire conviction in those who answer the call to turn to God.",
                "The display of God’s power, bringing back to life a woman who was on the verge of death, proved that consequences are best left with the Almighty himself. Those who trust in him need not fear, as His Son Christ gives strength and courage to those who seek refuge in His Name against the dwellers and princes of darkness. So too must those who serve Him be protected against the powers of wicked spirits that have diligently denied glorious living.",
                "The amazing power that had descended from above on the day of pentecost was to benefit the needy and show good through miracles such as the reawakening of Mrs Ben Masvaure. We had to express our joy and gratitude at this provision of divine relief. The crowd, spell-bound by the illness of one among them, unable to go about their daily duties under the shadow of death, was now free to sing through the night in praise of the Lord. The people were relieved, the burden was off their shoulders. God caused the anxiety binding a whole community in a hypnotic trance of helplessness to evaporate. The miracle was the acknowledgement by God that He had heard their plea and resolved to revive Mrs Masvaure’s dead pulse. It took God a few minutes to enable one who for nearly a month, could not walk, talk, eat or drink resume the basic functions and restart the senses which themselves had originally been handed down from the sacred chamber of the Creator.",
                "The gospel of truth could give back life. News of this miracle spread far and wide. People expressed total wonder, and related the event to everyone they met. The mention of a group propagating the Word of the Son of God and performing heavenly feats of healing in the Name of Jesus hailed our work to fame in the land of the Njanja and Hera people in the Charter and Buhera Districts. Many people trekked long distances bringing forward their loved ones who were suffering from a broad range of diseases. The Holy Spirit was with us the whole time we were faith-healing and aided us in preaching and converting those who came to Christ and accepted to give up their ways for salvation. A way of worshipping and calling people to repent and be baptised had taken root. There was no turning back."

                "1. **The tree growing in the temple**",
                "1.1 One night in this same year, a vision took me to the middle of a temple where a large rock had emerged from nowhere. A tree shot up from the top of this rock and began to grow quickly skyward while its trunk nurtured just as rapidly. The tree cracked its way through the dome of the temple and soared above the clouds and the blue sky shooting up higher and higher. I stood behind the altar all the while observing this spectacular growth. A voice suddenly came down the tree from high above and spoke to me in the temple. The voice said, “Look, I am coming down to talk to you face to face in the temple.”",
                "I spoke out lowly in reply, “May it be as it pleases you Lord. You may descend and say what you will to your servant my Lord.”",
                "1.2. A man, almost snow-white, strikingly handsome, and unlike any I had seen before or I would imagine to live on this earth suddenly appeared. The man was sturdily built and cut an exquisite figure even as he climbed down the tree with a touch of refined movement. When his feet touched the rock I craned at him and said, “Ya. I know you. You are Satan!” I lunged over to the rock to grab hold of the man and lifted him up above me before smashing him onto the floor of the temple. He died instantly. And the voice of God sounded immediately from above and spoke to me for a long time. The words that were told to me by the Lord Almighty God were words I was instructed to never repeat to any soul living on this earth. I woke up, knelt down, and prayed.",
                "2. **Defeat of the demonic angel of Satan**",
                "I recall on another occasion a vision that appeared in my sleep. A white man who looked like Jesus approached me from the northeast. He tried to say something to me and I said to him, “I recognise you, you are Satan.” I threw a hefty punch at him with all my strength. The boxer’s blow was so hard it knocked him out cold. He died.",
                "**Consecration as archbishop of Central Africa.**",
                "I heard the voice of God talk to me from above one night. The Almighty simply said, “Archbishop of Central Africa.” I woke up and enquired, “What do these words of the Lord mean? Our Methodist Church does not have bishops?”",
                "**The lamb of God descends from heaven on Friday 17 February 1956**",
                "4.1 I left Sadza in December 1955 to live at Chirasauta and work in my young brother Elijah Mwazha’s general dealer shop.",
                "4.2 I increased the amount of time I prayed both in the home and at secret places of prayer away from everyone else The local people learnt that I now stayed at Chirasauta and came forward to discuss with me about their converting to Christ. We began to pray for the sick on Wednesdays and Sundays as we had done earlier. The meetings offered the opportunity for faith-healing and brought more and more people to evangelical worship",
                "4.3 People experienced deliverance, miracles and healing. They gave testimony to God and His power to remove evil spirits, pagan worship, unveil darkness and substitute heathenistic ten dencies for a life of fellowship led by the Holy Spirit. The Holy Spirit brightened the lives of many people in the area and rescued souls trapped in the wizardry and magic of the devil.",
                "Evil spells that had crippled limbs were repelled and those who could not walk rose ecstatically to demonstrate on their feet that prayers said to God in faith removed suffering and healed the sick. God moves to the centre of dangerous situations when all else has failed to fulfil his promise. He is the Lord our healer, no barrier of blindness, deafness, madness, paralysis, psychosis, dumbness, neurosis or physical deformity can withstand His divine healing. It was not surprising therefore that people came from parishes of other denominations near Chirasauta, St Cecelia, St Jude, St Elizabeth and Dembwa to attend prayer sessions and to experience at first hand the live power of a God dedicated to the wellbeing of man He created in love and mercy in his own image.",
                "5. **Jesus descends from heaven on a white cloud accompanied by an angelic choir singing enchantingly: 17 February 1956.**",
                "5.1 It so happened that I was at some place in the east building a house. A man came up to me and asked me to attend a meeting in Central Africa.",
                "When I got to the conference, I approached the altar and paid my contribution of 25c, about half a crown, before receiving a membership card that would enable me to join the rest of the group. We seemed to be twelve or thirteen men with valid cards.",
                "5.2 I left the meeting when the conference ended to return to my construction site and completed my building. I was not too pleased with this house which had walls made of poles and mud. The wall was yet to be plastered and the roof was too low. The wall was yet to be plastered and the roof to be erected and thatched. I was disgusted by the appearance of my handiwork and despised it saying, “I do not wish to dwell in such an unappealing structure of wooden poles and mud walls with straw for a roof.”",
                "I thought to myself. “I shall head east to build a house of stone for myself.” I set off heading east and after a short distance a man I had never met before appeared in front of me heading in the same direction. He was to lead me to my destination.",
                "5.3. I followed the stranger until we got to some mountains and noticed in the distance two large rocks directly in front of us. The larger of the two which was further away dwarfed the rock closest to us as it was very high indeed. My escort climbed onto the smaller rock and I followed eagerly after him but failed to get up the rock. The gentleman got hold of my hand and helped me up the rock and disappeared soon after. I never saw him again.",
                "5.4 I stood on the spot he had been gazing at the large rock that soared up so high I could not see its summit. I heard a voice speak to me from above, “Look, the Lamb of God descends from heaven to earth.” I faced east and looked up to the sky to the sound of the most immaculate music I had ever listened to which was let out from above. A dazzling white cloud, bright as the sun sailed down from heaven. The huge rock blocked my view of the cloud. The voices that continued singing in perfect harmony reached out to the deepest part of my soul. The cloud floated in the sky northwards. The sweetest music continued from within.",
                "5.5 As I stood on the rock, the continent of Africa appeared before me. It was levelled like a veld without trees or mountains. The mountain I stood upon was the only prominent structure. As I looked, the cloud came down to the north of Africa and landed on the southern bank of the waters of the Mediterranean Sea. The music had not died down and I could still feel the sound from within the divine carrier. ‘",
                "5.6. The cloud began to ascend once more and a river rose from the north, on the south coast of the Mediterranean Sea flowing down the middle of Africa to the southern Pacific Ocean, The cloud sailed above the river southward as the water navigated through the vast continent. The river reached a point between Egypt and Ethiopia as they are known today and a small piece of the cloud broke off to remain hovering between the two countries. The cloud which was a divine craft ferried the Lord Jesus, the Lamb of God, and the leading archangels who accompanied Him and sang for Him songs of praise to His glory. Heaven continued to descend southward above the river until it came closer to where I stood on the mountain.",
                "5.7. I got down from the rock and walked to the east side to a river to receive the Lord who was visible in the cloud-craft sitting with the cream of heaven and the seniority of angels, gems of divine song. I walked and passed” the house I had started to build and had later rejected. I came to the conference site where I had earlier paid for a membership card. I later realised as I walked on, that there were twelve men also going my way. We walked along the river to get close to receive the Lord and His entourage. We looked up together and noticed the cloud-craft come close to where we stood and the music from within became more enticing and roused great joy in each of us.",
                "The cloud-craft faced us and the power of the Holy Spirit engulfed me causing me to speak out loudly, “Behold, I lay a tried and tested precious stone for a foundation in Zion.” He who believes will not be ashamed. The craft shuttled tracing the river from above. We ran along the bank toward the south of the river to try and meet the Lord.",
                "We waited a few yards below and I noticed two golden crosses come out of the leaves of a rich green bush by the river bank on our side of the river. I said to the men who were with me, “Look. These are the two crosses that are to remain in Central Africa. “God had determined the true destiny of Africa. Peace and prosperity would now bound in truth and would be certain if we carried out the will of the Lord.",
                "5.8. The divine cloud-craft headed down the river coming closer to where we stood. The Holy Spirit overcame me again at this moment and I began to praise the Lord in a raised voice, “Eli Jeso! Eli Jeso!” The craft proceeded past us heading south. We raced after it praising the Lord as we ran, “Eli Jeso, Eli Jeso, Eli Jeso,” until we got to the Drakensburg Mountains on the southern coast of the South Africa.",
                "5.9. I turned to my fellow travellers, “Boys! the Lord has to cover all the lands of the earth. Let us return to wait at the mountain.” We trailed back to the mountain where I had stood when I had heard the voice announce, “Look, the Lamb of God comes to earth.”"

                "On the 11th of April, 1956, I was asleep when I had a dream, the moon which was a bright white colour and shone vividly dropped from the sky and fell at my feet. I woke up and gave praise to God in prayer.",
                "2. **The man from Chomutumbi**",
                "The following month, on the eighth of May, 1956, a man from Chomutumbi visited me as I lay asleep. Chomutumbi is a mountain east of Chirasauta which is also a high mountain near where I lived at the time.",
                "He called out to me, the Lord is to hold a large meeting at the little mountain, I followed his indications and noticed a large crowd camped below Chomutumbi. I said, “That is the camp of the L.D.O.*” the man then disappeared. Immediately a young boy came to stand by the eastside window of the room I slept in and spoke to me, “Do you know that people in this village drink beer?” His skin was changing colour as he spoke until he was white before he too disappeared from view. I prayed. I have never eaten bread since, I had never tasted alcohol and I never consumed any. I got back to bed to have a dream with me singing the passage Isaiah 12.",
                "**The revelation of two men: 15.11. 1956**",
                "1. I saw two men bound by the Holy Spirit come toward me exclaiming that, “Truly you are an honest servant of God.”",
                "**The revelation of a trip in the jungle**",
                "I was walking alone in a thick uninhabited forest south of this country heading north. When I got to the middle of the forest I noticed a round thatched hut. I got closer to notice a man, a white man, who lived alone in this dense forest. He took a lantern and handed it to me. I used the lantern to light my path as I headed northward. It was getting toward dawn.",
                "After a few paces from where the white man stood, I picked up a lump of gold and a diamond worthy more than the quantity of gold. I said to myself, “I am heading for Harare with these stones where I will sell them to mineral experts.”",
                "I arrived in the city and met a white dealer who evaluated their worth. I handed him the gold first and he said it was worth one thousand pounds. I gave him the diamond and he said it was worth one million pounds. I was pleased and remarked, “With these millions of pounds I shall manage to build my house in Highfields and have enough to take care of my family and friends for the rest of our lives.”",
                "2. **The revelation of a place for requests: 22.12.1956**",
                "I heard a voice saying if anyone should have any problems and worries of any kind, they should go up Chirasauta mountain and God will listen to their pleas.” As the voice stopped I found myself still within the revelation sitting on top of Chirasauta. A man I did not know prayed with me until dawn.",
                "3. **The revelation of chasing Satan out of the temple using a cross**",
                "I entered the temple of God in Central Africa and found Satan already there. I grabbed a large cross of Jesus and hit at him. He crawled about on the floor trying to avoid my blows. I followed him whipping him with the cross of the Lord Jesus. He fled through the main entrance and persistently came back in through the door used by the church leaders. I rushed to him and swung at him until he scampered to hide behind the altar. I did not give up and got to where he was and struck him repeatedly until he got out of the building. He stayed outside the temple as the worshippers filed in until it was full. I gave grand praises to God for Satan had been defeated by the cross of Jesus reaffirming the power of the crucifixion and the victory that Jesus achieved over all evil when he died on the cross.",
                "4. **The revelation of the Holy Spirit: 22.10.1956**",
                "On 22nd of October, 1956 I recorded a vision that revealed the power of the Holy Spirit. I called out in my sleep filled by the Holy Spirit “You mighty Holy Spirit who came to earth to dwell with us. Thou the greatest Spirit who hast come to make thy residence here on our earth.” I went up a high mountain on 26th of October, 1956 and got to the summit to sit on a bench that was already at the top. I was startled when I saw my left hand holding holy ornaments. One was longer than the other and I reached down to the ground. The magnificent items were amazing to look at.",

I paced my hands on his head saying, “God save the Priest.” When I woke up I said, “A! God, I am not worthy to undertake work of such magnitude.”"

                "1. My heart praises God, He who has love and mercy for me. When I reflect on what he has done for me I am filled with great love for Him especially when I recall one Christmas day toward sunset while at the Holy mountain Chirasauta. God revealed to four people living in different areas what was to take place on the 25th of December that year.",
                "On Saturday that week, Mafoti and Chitedega came to visit me. Chitedega said, “I have brought Mafoti who had a dream praying together with you on Chirasauta mountain high on those whitish rocks. I asked him to come with me so that we can go up the mountain with you to pray. He says he saw you overcome by the Holy Spirit while you prayed together.”",
                "I answered them, “We shall go.” We prayed after supper and went to bed. The following day, very early in the morning, Fanuel Govere arrived and suggested that we go to a secret place of prayer in the thicket nearby. The two of us went alone and prayed. It was light when we finished and as we stood up to head back to the house, Govere said pointing to the mountain, “You see those white boulders at the top near those caves?” I said, “Hongu”. He said, “I had a dream in which you and I were praying in the cave and Jehovah filled you greatly with the Holy Spirit. I have come so that we go up together today and fulfil the dream.”",
                "I looked at him and said, “We shall go. But, you are the second person talking about climbing the mountain. Mafoti had the same dream as yours that is why he and Ezekiel Chitedega are here.”",
                "2. We got back to the house and joined the others for breakfast before going to the Sunday service at Chirasauta Methodist Church. When we got to the Church, a woman I knew, Runia Tawira came over to me and said, “Servant of God, I had a dream last night, I saw you praying at the top of Chirasauta by the caves close to the summit you were with one other gentleman. Jehovah made you very drunk with the Holy Spirit and all you could say was, **‘Aleluya Amen, Jesu, Tenzi Jehovah’**, I would think it wise for you to go up the mountain and pray.”",
                "I also replied, “That is correct. You are the third person to advise me on praying at the caves. We intend to go up after the church service.”",
                "3. As we approached Evangelist Dahwa’s house he said to me “Servant of God, today I had a dream I was with you praying by those caves up the mountain Chirasauta and the Holy Spirit came upon you with such might as never before.”",
                "I looked at him and said, ‘You are the fourth person to say so. You notice these men also had the same revealed to them that is what they come to tell me. We have arranged to climb up Chirasauta to pray at the caves.",
                "We came out of church and I got a group of seven men, F. Govere, Ezekiel Chitedega, W. Dahwa, Mafoti, Nhondoro, F. Mubayi and E. Tendayi and went up to the caves. **We sang and prayed at three places climbing higher each time.**",
                "At the third station, the Holy Spirit overwhelmed my heart while I placed my chest against the rock for support. We made our way further up squeezing through a narrow passage with difficulty to get to God’s cave where we sang and prayed. **I was kneeling on the right of everyone and closest to the rock (Dombo).** When time came the Holy Spirit came upon me and my chest was filled. I began to speak in tongues. The divine power of God overcame me and filled my whole body. My right leg which was leaning on the Dombo was lifted, certainly not by me. **The Holy Spirit in me began to call out - “Shiloh! Shiloh! Shiloh!”** I felt my body lifted up and carried away from the rest of the group and placed on the Dombo. It was not humanly possible for any one to get to that point.",
                "4. I sat on the top of the Dombo high up **looking eastward.** The Holy Spirit made me talk in different languages. I could speak in tongues and I noticed at this point the Eastern Star become clearly visible in broad daylight. It shimmered in the sun. The tongues continued and I wondered why the Star came up and was so vividly visible at such an odd hour before dark. More strangely was that the Star had come out breaking the astrological pattern that is common with the emergence of the stars. This occurrence in broad daylight was God’s way of showing me His immense power over all creation. **He could move the stars and place man anywhere at anytime.** He had power to determine sequences, reverse routine of nature and convey a message to believers through a real life revelation plain for all to see. God was among the living on the earth. He had shown that He was at Chirasauta.",
                "The Star of Shiloh began to set slowly in the east until it got below the horizon. The Holy Spirit and the tongues became more prolific as the apparition had made it plain to me that what I had seen had come from God who is in heaven. My heart grew fonder and my love for Jesus Christ my protector was made manifold. I praised God Almighty, He who cares for us and loves us in all that we are and for all that we do. God is oblivious to our misdemeanor and overlooks our earthly way of life that is sinful at most.",
                "I stood before God on the top of the Rock. I looked around me still enveloped by the Holy Spirit and noticed the Star reemerge, it rose slowly getting higher into the clear blue sky until it got to the point I had first noticed it. The Star was now dazzlingly bright in front of my eyes.",
                "I exclaimed, “A! God you have boundless mercy toward me. Why is your love for me so intense? I stand here to give witness to the might of heaven.” God my heart fills with pleasure at the beauty of heaven.”",
                "At that moment my heart was overwhelmed with joy and the feeling of entering the world of the living. I made all these utterances in tongues. I was in the bushel of the Holy Spirit. I now wished for my friends to see what I saw. **I controlled the Holy Spirit** to allow me to call out, “Men, Men”. **They chorused in reply “Baba”. Father.**",
                "I ordered them, “Come up through the creek quickly.” Almost immediately before they could get to where I was, the Star shot up flashed paa-a to the east before sinking into the horizon. The group struggling to come up got to a vantage point where they could look east but did not see the Star. They saw nothing. The Star had gone down.",
                "I requested Mafoti to pray. But the Star did not reappear. I said resignedly, “A. What had God done to me? I had wished for you all to see the Star of Shiloh which I was watching. When I called you it shot downward and sank out of sight.”",
                "Chitedega Ezekiel responded, “Aiwa, not to worry, the revelation was not meant for all of us but was yours alone, that is why God removed it just as you called us to come up to see.” I was concerned and concluded, “It does make me seem not to be telling the truth.”",
                "Ezekiel reassured me, “Kwete, no we were not permitted to see the vision.” The men helped me down from the top of the Rock where I had been placed delicately by the Holy Spirit. We started our descend from the rock to the caves and as we slowly made our way down, we noticed that the trees, the ground and the rocks were covered in what appeared to be snow. Wherever we looked was covered with this bright whiteness. We got to the cave and found it carpeted with the white granules.",
                "6. The rest of the group was engulfed by the Holy Spirit and began to speak in tongues praising God who has the power to perform miracles and display profound examples of His might. The men clapped their hands in applause and, began shouting gleefully, “Come and see mana - iwe!” I cautioned them with my hands and ordered them not to call it what it might not be. Mana-looking, yes... but name, may be not. Some wanted to take the snowy white granules back with us, “Let us bring this stuff home for those left behind.” I said, “No.”",
                "One of the most significant revelations to Jesus when accompanied on the Mount by Peter and John.\nMatthew 17:1-3\nMark 9:28-32\nLuke 9:1-4",
                "prayers. We prayed and sang intermittently until dawn before we set off for the mountain as the sun came up. This time, Elijah my young brother joined us **as had been stated by the Holy Spirit.** We got into the cave and broke into song. We prayed. While we were deep in prayer I was at a distance from the rest of the group close to the cave wall and visionarily noticed an axe with a dove stuck to it.",
                "9. The bird was not dead. I took the bird and passed it to Elijah. The vision ended when he grabbed hold of it. I related the fulfillment of the words of the prophetess Amai Gwavava to everyone after we finished giving thanks and praises to God. We left for home after dark, but on this day, we did not see the Star or the experience of the day before. We sang gleefully as we came down the rocky path to head for home. We were at peace within ourselves."

            content: [
                "In the Charter District, Enkeldoorn, which is now known as Chivhu, the work of our Lord Jesus Christ spread far and wide, **We moved to various places speaking to fallen men** asking that they come forward and be ministered to by Jesus Christ. The indwelling Holy Spirit would thereafter take charge and develop a desire in people **to fight evil** and resist the temptations sent by Satan to transgress us. We went round demonstrating to people the sinfulness of Satan and advising through prayer and the gospel how best to build a new life influenced by the Holy Spirit to hate sin. Many people were overwhelmed by the power of God to heal and drive out demons. Much of what took place was set off against the perception of sin and its consequences of an imperfect life without a glimmer of hope.",
                "1. During this period, a man called Dyara Chirisa came to me saying, “Valsaiah Mutyasira, is dying slowly. He only has a low heart beat left. They are waiting for you to come and pray for him to get better.” I jumped on my bicycle and rode hurriedly to the sick man’s home.",
                "As we got closer to the house, a bright meteoric streak of light followed a shooting star that came to a stand-still a few metres above the hut housing the sick man.",
                "I asked my companion if he had noticed the star. He had not. We arrived to be greeted with cries in the homestead and met by crowds, well-wishers and curious spectators. Most had come to pay their last respects to a man they were sure was to die shortly. It would be too costly for these villagers to trek back to their homes and only to be told to return for a funeral. I asked the men who received me to tell all those crying to stop. I asked the mourners to be quiet and when there was silence we entered the room where the corpse now lay surrounded by close family members, mostly women. I addressed them curtly, “Did you not call me to pray to God regarding the deceased?”",
                "They accented. I added, “It should be alright then if you could all be quiet so that I can pray to God.” A hush fell upon the room while I remained standing there quietly waiting for those kneeling by the dead body to make room for me. I got on my knees and looked into the corpse. I prayed to God. The Holy Spirit descended upon me almost immediately. The dead man lying in front of me woke up and he too was enveloped by the Holy Spirit and rushed out into the open air.",
                "People stood agape. They could not believe their eyes. Their bewilderment could not be contained to see a man they were mourning a few seconds ago jumping around and shouting excitedly at the top of his voice. The Holy Spirit directed him back into the room he had laid dead in. I asked him to kneel before me and I placed my hands on his head in the Name of Jesus and prayed for him.",
                "I requested that he be given food and drink. He had a good appetite.",
                "The villagers who had come to grieve for a lost friend prepared to depart for their homes. Some excitedly related the story to all they met giving witness to the healing power of God, and to His love and mercy, demonstrated with the strength to overcome death. **The dead can be resurrected** through faith and obedience in the Name of Jesus who promised that whatever we desire we shall receive if we abide by the will of God the Father. We praised the God of the Heavens whose tender mercy came to **relieve us of remorse and lamentation.**",
                "The faith of many was rekindled as the divine healing was itself an assurance that the Lord is a great healer and provider of life. The people believed that they had found an answer to all their problems and Satan was not likely to harass them much more. God would protect them and demonic spirits would be cast away.",
                "2. Mr Mungore came to me one day and asked that, “My sister, Marunjeya is under duress from an evil spirit that has possessed her for some years now. My father pleads that you come to pray so that she can be healed.” I went to see the woman that evening and found the woman sprawled on the floor hitting her head on the hard surface. When I saw the violent rage of this demonic spirit and her deliberate clapping **I felt fear creep into me** and I started thinking of ways to get out of the responsibility of praying for the woman. My hesitation led me to employ delaying tactics, and I said, “If I am to pray for this woman, her mother and brothers must confess their sins before us now.”",
                "They replied, “We cannot relate our shortcomings on behalf of the woman who is old enough to speak for herself. You can pray for her and afterwards she can speak to free herself.”",
                "The Holy Spirit came over me and I heard myself shout, “Aleluya!” My arms were raised high in the air, and the possessed woman was lifted to her feet shouting, “Aleluya! Aleluya! Aleluya!” and she was healed. I laid my hands on her head and prayed for her. The woman has never relived the experience of demons since that day many years ago. The spirit of evil has not revisited her.",
                "3. I responded to an urgent invitation at Chidziva to help Elijah Chidziva’s daughter who was married to Magwenzi and could not deliver her baby safely. The pregnant woman had been placed on a drum and was surrounded by the midwives who waited for her to go into labour. The expectant mother was shrouded in a large white cloth. When I was possessed by the Holy Spirit I prayed for the woman who I could see had a baby boy in her womb and she would deliver the child that same day. The woman survived her ordeal and is still happily married today.",
                "4. The healing of the wife of Jeffries Magaba. This is how it happened. One Wednesday during the evening prayers, Leornard Mushoriwa stood up and informed, “I have my young brother’s wife who is eight months pregnant but the baby does not move. The poor woman is worried and frightened that she might die together with the baby.”",
                "I responded in the guidance of the Holy Spirit, “The movement of the baby in the womb is not true. That the baby does not move is also not true. Bring the woman to me so that we can pray and appeal to God for her.”",
                "Amai Magaba was brought to me on the Wednesday of the following week. **The woman stood up to repent her sins and to explain away her misdeeds. She wore no head scarve and her hair was long and entwined. I presumed that it was because of worry.** The woman came up the queue when it was her turn and knelt in front of God. I told her the message of the Holy Spirit, “God says that you shall deliver your baby safely when the time comes. **It shall be a boy.** The baby began to move violently inside her before it was time and when the day of delivery came, she had a healthy baby boy. The child was named Ishmael as I had been instructed by the Holy Spirit. At the time of writing, Ishamael was in Form Two at Bernard Mizeki College.",
                "5. **A preacher for the Church of England** who lived at St Elizabeth near Chirasauta, was struck by a spell while driving his cattle ploughing his vegetable garden. He was knocked to the ground and his right arm and leg became paralysed. He was brought into the house and lay in the home for two weeks unable to move. The family sent for me to come and ask the Lord God to heal him. Firigiyasi Gudzwende and I visited the Anglican Church preacher **who repented his sins before I laid my hands on him** in the Name of the Lord Jesus and he was cured. His limbs were strengthened and he could go about carrying out his chores and normal tasks unperturbed by pain.",
                "6. One day, late in the middle of the night I woke up to loud knocking on our door. I asked who it could be, “I am Davison Mushipe, I bring my baby boy with me. He is very ill. He is about to die. Man of God I come with my father and mother-in-law and some of my relatives are here with us because the baby’s state has worsened.”",
                "I said to him, “You may all go into the visitors hut and sleep. I shall join you in the morning and we shall pray for the baby.” I did not open the door to look at them. They proceeded to go to sleep.",
                "We woke up at daybreak and prayed for the baby who seemed to have been healed! I said to them, “Is this the sick baby that so many of you grouped together to bring to me in the middle of the night?” The father of the child answered, “**A. Your God is amazing Father.** The baby was seriously ill and we did not think we could walk this far while it lived. But **as we got into your yard, the baby began to recover.**”",
                "The group turned to God. The family remain in fellowship to this day. The father of the child, David Mushipe is a reverend in this, The African Apostolic Church in Central Africa.",
                "People kept coming from all around Chirasauta with a broad range of ailments and diseases that worried them. The many who came were cured and their faith strengthened as God had, through his Son Jesus Christ, **taken charge of all infirmities and no illness could withstand His divine power of healing.**",
                "Mr Gombe, one of our leading churchmen fell ill and Mr Mukumba and I went to visit him. The man was sleeping in a makeshift camp. He could not leave his bed nor eat or talk. He looked very sick indeed.",
                "We sang for the Lord and prayed for him. I stood up and entranced by the Holy Spirit, I looked to the heavens and spoke out to the Lord, “Lord Jesus, **it is you who sent me to preach your Gospel and to heal the sick.** Look, Almighty, this man lying sick before you believes in you. Please Lord come now to relieve him of his pain.”",
                "**As I stood praying, facing the east, I suddenly noticed the Lord Jesus floating in the air in front of me. We looked at each other. We were very close.** I said, “I thank you my Lord for coming. Now please place your hands on this sick man so that he may be healed.” Jesus moved to the sick man and put his right hand on Gombe’s head. Mr Gombe fell to the ground and died. I remarked in alarm, “What happened my Lord for this man to die. I thought I had called you so that you could heal him? Lord this man must arise and be healed.” The dead man arose and sat up. I continued talking to Jesus, “Lord this man must be healed, he must stand up and walk.” Still in the vision, Gombe did get up and walked home completely recovered. I said that the Lord should be praised, “See Lord, I thank you. May Gombe’s days on this earth be increased.” Mr Gombe’s recovery was total and he eagerly continued to farm his land that summer. I praised God saying, “A, my Lord, I honour you. You are good, my God. May this man remain healthy and strong until he is a ripe old age.” **I saw Gombe sit on top of a cloud. His head white with grey hair.**",
                "When I finished my prayers, Jesus had disappeared. I related the vision to everyone. Gombe still lay dead before me. I knew that he would wake up that same day and would lead the life that had been described before me by the Lord Jesus. I placed my hands on him and he was healed instantly. The family began to leave the camp for their home. This man, Gombe managed to recover completely until he was a grey-haired old man. Our God should be praised as his love for us on earth is great indeed."

                "Our members grew as many people carry me forward to reject the devil working in their lives. Worshippers strived to make room for a new experience that brought man close to God. God showed that he longs for the betterment of His people and will conquer death to dilute the alienation between Himself and man, the crown of His creation. We sang hymns and said prayers, people spoke in tongues and miracles were performed. These divine gifts were immediate to those who repented and were converted. Repentance was accessible through Jesus Christ who was sent by God the Father to carry our burdens upon the cross and shed his blood in order to have us cleansed.",

                "I turned to one of the elders, Loveless Manhango sitting next to me and said “Friend did you hear a voice from heaven?” He said, “No”. I went on to say that the voice was from God and was naming the church, The African Apostolic Church. Manhango said, “Teacher, what do you think of it?” I acknowledged that if we were to begin our own church the name had come from heaven above.",
                "Manhango thought it ironic that I could accept a name when I had objected to members leaving their respective denominations. I reaffirmed what the voice had said to me and could not argue further.",
                "**Twelve men are required**",
                "I had a dream one night in which I saw a peach tree on the east side of our home grounds. I came out of the house and walked to the fruit-tree. I counted six large dark peaches which were a healthy normal fruit. As I walked away from this tree back into the house I heard a voice of the King of all creation say from above “Twelve men are needed.” I stopped and walked back to the tree and recounted the fruit. There were three new peaches to make a total of nine. I woke up and got to my knees to pray to God. I learnt that God wanted us to build an independent congregation of the Apostles of Africa and as had been his word, that twelve men were required to carry on his work.",
                "**I decide to set up a church congregation**",
                "I never felt the urge to set up a church despite the visions and the requests by close friends, followers and believers. We continued to meet on Wednesday and Friday evenings every weok. Jesus Christ the Lord would always be with us during these sessions. The Lord would lead our propagation of the gospel, the performance of miracles, the wonders of healing and the revelations of his power enacted in His name. Members of our group would split on Sundays to fellowship in their different denominations. Some would join the Anglicans while others returned to the Methodist Church.",
                "One day I had a revelation where I found myself in a courtroom at the Enkeldoorn Court House in Charter town. I asked the white magistrate who sat placidly behind the court-bench for permission to start a church. “Your worship I wish to start my own church.” The man replied that I would not be allowed to do as I wished. “Kwete....” The court interpreter suddenly came through the door used by the magistrate into the room and asked the magistrate what it was I wanted in the courtroom.",
                "The magistrate stated that I had requested for a church and he had turned down my proposal. The magistrate stated that, “I told him that no African is allowed to set up their own church.”",
                "The interpreter to the court said, “No, your worship, nobody, is barred from setting up a church if they so wish.” The magistrate, who granted me permission to start a church turned to me, “Give me his book.” I handed him a notebook I had in my hand. He opened it and made three ticks. He gave back the booklet. When I took it from his hand I woke up and praised God in prayer. I felt pleased.",
                "The vision was the third sign pointing us toward the decision whether we should go independent or remain part of the conventional groups of worship.",
                "4. **The Church is established**",
                "I was now sure in my heart that God had commissioned me to set up the church of His Son Jesus Christ in Central Africa. It happened therefore that in the autumn of 1959, the African Apostolic Church was founded and began to take root.",
                "In my capacity as the commissioned servant of the Lord, I stood as bishop to lay the foundations of the organisation of the church. I ordained and appointed some of the group members into positions necessary for the smooth running of the church. Loveless Manhango was made reverend; Joseph Chakawa, evangelist; Samuel Manhango, prophet; Thomas Chisango, secretary. I made these nominations after Chief Neshangwe and the white District Commissioner of Charter had granted me permission.",
                "We began conducting baptisms for everyone in the Name of the Father, the Son and the Holy Spirit. We travelled in Charter, Buhera preaching and faith-healing. The Apostolic Church began to grow and pread across the then Rhodesia which is now Zimbabwe."
