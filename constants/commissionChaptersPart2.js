'**UNKNOWN**' meaning that I or my angel are not known yet or easily to anyone. Now, you will recall what our Lord Jesus Christ said to his disciples the other day. \"There is one among you whom you do not know?\" This vision or revelation built a firm confidence in me, making me more than convinced that the African Apostolic Church was to benefit from the participation of the twelve apostles from the team of the Holy Lamb, Jesus.",

They have made several attempts at having children, but all five pregnancies ended with the healthy children dying as toddlers. As it is, they have no living offspring. Their problem is this successive and unexplained loss of children. All their children have died soon after birth\". I looked at the helpless couple whose faces were emotionless and resignant. I felt sorry for them as these deaths, like cot deaths, left a heavy burden that deepened a sense of guilt, a feeling of negligence, unworthiness and suspicion in the parents.",
                "2. I spoke to the visitors, \"Ko, What do you think can be done about it?\" They replied, \"We come to you man of God so that you may ask your God, He that you pray to, that this couple must have children who will survive beyond childhood.\" I responded thinking ahead, beyond the day and night before us, \"Well, it may be all right. Will you spend the night, tomorrow we shall ascend Chirasauta mountain yonder to pray. We shall present this matter to God Almighty in the name of Jesus Christ our Lord\".",
                "3. We held prayers in our home and adjourned to bed that night, before we rose very early to set off for the holy mountain. We got to the bottom of Chirasauta and each had to ask for forgiveness for sins unreservedly. This atonement session was to ensure that our path and intentions were clear of negative forces whose satanic powers would delay the response on the married and pitiful childless couple. The Holy Spirit immediately engaged my thoughts and advised that I inform Austen Mucha and his wife that, \"God has felt pity on them and their wish will be fulfilled. They bear children free from early death. As of today, their offspring will grow beyond childhood into young healthy boys and girls. Their first child will be girl, her name is to be Tsitsi as the Lord God has felt pity upon them\".",
                "4. We ended the prayer session by the laying on of hands on the pair in despair in the name of Jesus. We got down the mountain and they left happy in the hope that they would now have children who would grow up.",
                "5. Indeed as expected, the Holy Spirit had been direct in its revelation to me. A baby girl was born, they called her Tsitsi as was instructed by the heavens above. Soon after Tsitsi was weaned they had another child, a boy, Shepherd Mucha.",
                "6. A third child was born into the Mucha family and they called him Timothy. They went on to have five more children. A total of eight! All their children are Still alive to this day.",

                "8. Austen Mucha and his wife are the first couple in the African Apostolic Church whose repeated child or infant deaths were stopped by prayer in the name of Jesus Christ. It is also fulfilment of God's prophecy that, ever since, all who experienced this sad state came forward to be freed and healed and their inexplicable dilemma simply never recurred. We placed this phenomena that defied all logic and scientific explanation to it's right source, the Holy Spirit. The Spirit of Christ is given to all who are His, it sets believers free, provides assurance and hope and enables them to live in the confidence that God is working for them. God is God, He can and does act as He will.

The barren would bore children. Recurrent loss of life in the very young would be stopped as happened with Austen Mucha. These miraculous events could not be contained and word spread profusely across the region prompting others to gather up and travel to our home in search of an end to their dilemma. Costel Makono brought his first wife for faith healing. Elliot Mushipe could not have children, he too came together with his wife. I laid hands on their heads in worship to God and asked for God to feel pity upon these poor souls and grant their wish, always in the name of Jesus Christ.",
                "Costel Makono had been together with his wife for three years, a period considered in our African tradition to be long enough for the pair to have had children. Elliot Mushipe had worried on whether he would ever have a family. The two couples were leading a disturbing life in the face of family pressure that a marriage be bonded by children - accusations from the respective families were rife, each accusing the other of being unable to reproduce. It was therefore that the Mushipe family arrived worn with worry and the undignified murmurings on their biological inadequacies.",
                "2. I took the two pairs to the rock of wishes on the top of Mount Chirasauta and had them both say aloud to the lord their wish to start a family. We sang to God and took turns to each go through a process of self-denial. Painful truths had to come out Especially your relationship to God. I asked each pair to kneel before me facing east. The wife knelt to the left of her husband. I simultaneously placed hands on each head and prayed - \"Lord God, please may you in the name of your son, Jesus Christ, make this man and wife conceive\". It was almost immediately that the Holy Spirit descended upon me and advised that I tell the pair, \"You shall have many children who will fill your home. Your first born shall be a girl\".",
                "Costel Makono and his wife took their turn and knelt before me. I prayed asking the Lord to show his kind mercy upon them. The spirit took over and ratified this, \"Udza - tell - Elliot that the Lord Jehovah shall make him and his wife happy for his wife is soon to conceive and bear a baby girl to be named 'Fadzi'! Fadzi, short for Fadzai means Provision of Joy.",
                "4. We came down the mountain at the end of this intense session and headed for home. Mr and Mrs Makono had a girl whom they called Irene as the Holy Spirit had guided. The Mushipe couple received Fadzi barely nine months after we came down Mount Chirasauta where God Almighty had not only announced that they would have children but had the name of their daughter given to them.",
                "5. The Makono family has grown to nine children, Irene the eldest had four of her own. I recall to mind eight children born to Elliot Mushipe, Fadzi had two children at the time of writing. Fadzi was however married to Murena Churu for four years before she had children. We began to ask the Good for His mercy so that Fadzi could also have children in the Name of Jesus Christ our Lord. The word of the Holy Spirit spoke without hesitation \"Fadzi shall conceive and have a baby boy\", and so it was that Fadzi' parents had a grandson.",
                "6. Indeed, the events of these prophetic - hearings were accounted across the country. The Holy Spirit of the Lord was now abundant and easily poured upon the needy. We encountered evil throughout application of the gospel, the emancipated mind was able to destroy the works of the devil. Those who believed would have it come to be that, visions shall relate the supernatural powers that would descend in God's holiness To erase all evil Spirits, cast out evil, cure all types of diseases, open the eyes of the blind, raise the dead and loosen all satanic bonds to leave the believer free and ready to receive deliverance. The African Apostolic Church could, and only in the Name of Jesus Christ, ask that God make it possible, by simple faith in His plain word, for people to be granted their wishes. The word spread therefore and people like those with the problem of childbearing came forward in faith and have it cease by the laying on hands. The simple faith of Galilee made miracles happen.",
                "7. The Holy Spirit, the Spirit of God showed the presence of God Almighty in all that the African Apostolic Church was to do, it ensured that God could respond to the request made by man, it was worthy for man to atone for his sins so that his demonic realm would be brushed away at a stroke by God himself It was therefore that those who could have girls only, or simply a line of boys could now ask for a change which was effected. All the Almighty asked for was that they give themselves to God, be baptised, and change their way of life and their wish would come true.",
                "9. The power of the gospel of Jesus eased some of the hardships of life. Daily living had a glimmer of hope because of worshipping in the church. Experience showed that God provided us with what we desired from Him. Where there was no hope ever of receiving or achieving God stood in time to grant to those who believed. What was possible was only so because of prayer, because of God, because of our Lord Jesus Christ. Great joy and pleasure grew among the believers as the presence of God was close and all felt a sense of belonging to God. Peace developed among them. John 24.27",

We received wisdom, experienced divine revelations and the heavens opened to have the depth of the knowledge of God pour on the eager evangelists who rose at each prayer session to preach the gospel asking all present to become new men and women who surrendered and buried bad habits with the act of baptism. A new life certainly began thereafter.",
                "The congregation brought a new warmth into Zimbabwe, the spiritual fire cut across the country bringing with it a salvation that quenched the dryness of an unfriendly society now bereft of its dignity and made shy of its tradition and culture. The gospel shot its powerful beam through the wretched darkness of the lives of an ill-fated people licking everywhere with its divine light and leaving no mystery or secret of the immense power of God unexplained for the comprehension of the simplest mind.",
                "2. All the time we gathered to fellowship, the singing would move non-devotees to join. The Holy Spirit which always came to be among us, encouraged many to convert into the African Apostolic Church. Jesus Christ alone drove these many people to join us. They became dedicated followers who would never look back.",
                "The number of worshippers began to grow and so too did the groups which arranged into local parishes led by pastors supported by evangelists.

                "1. The Holy Spirit, in scriptural fulfilment, was a guide to the Church. We received wisdom, experienced divine revelations and the heavens opened to have the depth of the knowledge of God pour on the eager evangelists who rose at each prayer session to preach the gospel asking all present to become new men and women who surrendered and buried bad habits with the act of baptism. A new life certainly began thereafter.",
                "The congregation brought a new warmth into Zimbabwe, the spiritual fire cut across the country bringing with it a salvation that quenched the dryness of an unfriendly society now bereft of its dignity and made shy of its tradition and culture. The gospel shot its powerful beam through the wretched darkness of the lives of an ill-fated people licking everywhere with its divine light and leaving no mystery or secret of the immense power of God unexplained for the comprehension of the simplest mind.",
                "2. All the time we gathered to fellowship, the singing would move non-devotees to join. The Holy Spirit which always came to be among us, encouraged many to convert into the African Apostolic Church. Jesus Christ alone drove these many people to join us. They became dedicated followers who would never look back.",
                "The number of worshippers began to grow and so too did the groups which arranged into local parishes led by pastors supported by evangelists. Some of the early groups were established Manicaland Province, Masvingo, Midlands, Mashonaland, and Matebeleland. The church moved into all the towns, rural settlements, and remote villages. A uniformity of African worship of the gospel of Christ had emerged to take root. Spreading like a cool refreshing breeze cutting through the tropical air of a dry day after the torrential downpour."

                "1. The above is one of the most Holy places found in our land. I flew passed this place one day. I noticed a large rock that had a wide crack its eastside. Two doves or birds of peace roosted on the boulder.",
                "2. I had been to this rock on foot in my waking life someday on my way to pray to God and had again noticed the birds alighted peaceably on the same spot. I had walked from the east and circled the hillock to approach my place of prayer from the west side.",
                "3. As I approached the rock upon which the two birds rested, a cavity opened and from what seemed to be a deep alley leading into a cave a bright ray of light shone revealing a Temple expansed with decorations of all gold.. The rock slid to close off this magnificent view almost immediately and once again it was all bush, grass and rock before me. I felt tantalised and hoped to witness the entrance to the temple open again.",
                "4. My hope was realised when on yet another visit to the same spot, The Temple, I saw the pair of doves perched on the rock as if on guard. I followed my usual route to approach the place from the west. The rock glided open, heavy granite moving slowly apart to expose a bright light from deep within and tills time, a voice called out clearly, \"Ndarikure! \". The name of this Temple from whence a bright shimmer of light emerged to distinctly outline the walls of a building adorned with ornaments of gold. Again the Temple disappeared as suddenly as it had appeared. I was back to the stark reality of the dense forest, without a trace of the opulence I had seen.",
                "5. The Temple was revealed to me on three consecutive times. I kept up my outward bound journeys preaching the gospel across the whole of Dzimbabwe visiting both towns and villages. I was aware that the divine shrine of the Almighty was not too far from us, and the Lord only shows us that which is possible for us to receive from Him.",
                "6. It was that I found myself in a spirit-vision one day. I owned a home made of gold of the highest quality at Chivavarira east of the Gonawapotera.",
                "7. I was the high priest of God in this glistening village which stood atop the mountain Chivavarira. The homestead shone as never seen before. My heart was overwhelmed with immense joy as I felt a sense of belonging to this beautiful dwelling.",
                "8. I left this grand village one morning and headed for Ndarikure on foot. I noticed a while later that I walked on a path paved with bricks of gold and lined with precious stones on either side.",
                "9. The cobbled path of gold led all the way to Ndarikure where I came to the Temple which had earlier closed its doors on me. This time, the entrance shone with its doors wide open. I was allowed to enter the building, which I did.",
                "10. I stood in the middle of this bewildering magnificent structure totally amazed by its beauty when a man came out, an Angel, who entered through the north side entrance of God's Temple.",
                "11. \"A, you have come at last\". The angel acknowledged my arrival and presence. I felt I had been expected. The divine messenger continued, \"You are early. Please go back and only return here for your conferment into the priesthood after the altar is set up and all the building work is completed.",
                "12. I stood my ground. Unmoved, I spoke to the heavenly messenger albeit politely, \"It is not possible for me to go away without you ordaining me. This is a very difficult place to find, let alone get to. Every time I have managed to get this far, the Temple has opened for a voice to declare\" \"Ndarikure!\" and the great door automatically shuts in my face giving me little chance to do anything\".",
                "13. Our debate became vehement and now raged on. The Angel whose firm suggestion that I go home and I strongly resisted was dressed in white. The figure before me was heard scarfed with a white cloth flowing down to the toes. The angel had the face of a woman who now turned to face north-west of the Temple as a door opened for a taller broader figure to come into the room.",
                "14. An elderly looking messenger came into the centre of the Temple very close to were the two of us stood. This was a man whose attire was similar to that of my female acquaintance. He asked \"Ya, what is the matter here?\" My woman friend spoke to the man, \"It is Mwazha. He says he is here to be ordained into His divine priesthood\". The latest arrival was of a higher rank and standing close to my lady companion.",
                "15. The senior messenger proceeded to enquire sternly, \"Ko, so what is the hold up?\" The younger of the two angels explained, \"I told him that he should go away and only come back when the Altar has been erected\". The senior messenger turned to me in and said that I should go and return in future some time.",
                "16. I was unshaken and I stood firmly in my response, \"It is not possible for me to go back without you ordaining me first. As i explained before, this is a very difficult site to get to my Lord. The entrance closes up and disappears every time the voice announces \"Ndarikure!\" It always takes time for the journey to take place again. This is an unwelcome drawback always.",
                "17. The elderly angel developed a change of heart and instructed the younger, \"Yes, you may proceed to anoint him\". The messenger hesitated and wondered, \"Where am I to perform this task\". The man-angel replied calmly, \"You may do so on the exact spot the Altar shall be placed\". He said pointing at the spot where i assumed with rationale that the Altar would be placed in this large hall of golden wonderment.",
                "18. It was therefore that the young angel with the face of a woman took me by the hand and led me to the east side of the Temple.",
                "19. I was made to lie on the floor of the Temple at the proposed site of the Altar. She began to rub my head swiftly but gently on the golden floor of the shrine. She faced east all the while saying, \"In the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Ghost, Amen.\"",
                "20. I woke up from this divine oracle and gave full praises to God, \"A! God, you are full of amazing glorious love indeed\" I wondered how you always have time for the unworthy! The wretched like me? You have placed exaltations and the delightful and amazing glory of your most dear love in Zimbabwe that is of Africa\".",

            content: [
                "1. We arranged that all members of the African Apostolic Church who live in the same neighbourhood should meet regularly until the end of the world. They should worship together, preach the gospel and care for the sick through faith healing. Special sessions that allowed those with the gift to prophecy were to be permitted. Our days of prayer were set for each Wednesday, Friday and Sunday of every week. Preparation for the day the lamb of God would come was paramount in the life of the believer.",
                "2. Prayers on Wednesdays and Fridays were evening sessions usually at the end of the working day. A number of the small groups would come together on Sunday to form the size of a parish. We did not at this time honour the seventh day of the week, the Holy Sabbath. The Holy Spirit of the Lord conveyed to us the importance of the Sabbath in the sacred mountain Gawambwa later in 1972. We managed to have the worshippers accept to abide by the fourth commandment many years after the initial notice from above. I shall dwell below on how the church adopted the Holy Sabbath in 1979 and began to adhere to it willingly thereafter.",
                "3. We also increased the number of gatherings, arranging for regional church groups in the same district to come together for two to three days or longer for fellowship, adventure into scriptures and scholarly searches in order to understand God. The gatherings would take place in places removed from villages and not frequented by people as picnic sites or leisure resorts. The remote places of prayer were normally in the hills or in the thickness of virgin forests. We chose sites near rivers for fresh water to drink and bath.",
                "4. Many who came would join the church, choose to be baptised and accept the teaching and ways of God as was taught by Jesus, Matthew 28:18 - 20; Acts 2:41 - 42.",
                "We preached that we must love and serve God accepting the transcendent reality of God. We taught the people the birth, baptism, and death of Jesus Christ which formed the bedrock of worship, our teaching and life of our membership. The process was akin to the African way of life, one is born, grows through adulthood, married life and proceeds to death.

                "1. We arranged that all members of the African Apostolic Church who live in the same neighbourhood should meet regularly until the end of the world. They should worship together, preach the gospel and care for the sick through faith healing. Special sessions that allowed those with the gift to prophecy were to be permitted. Our days of prayer were set for each Wednesday, Friday and Sunday of every week. Preparation for the day the lamb of God would come was paramount in the life of the believer.",
                "2. Prayers on Wednesdays and Fridays were evening sessions usually at the end of the working day. A number of the small groups would come together on Sunday to form the size of a parish. We did not at this time honour the seventh day of the week, the Holy Sabbath. The Holy Spirit of the Lord conveyed to us the importance of the Sabbath in the sacred mountain Gawambwa later in 1972. We managed to have the worshippers accept to abide by the fourth commandment many years after the initial notice from above. I shall dwell below on how the church adopted the Holy Sabbath in 1979 and began to adhere to it willingly thereafter.",
                "3. We also increased the number of gatherings, arranging for regional church groups in the same district to come together for two to three days or longer for fellowship, adventure into scriptures and scholarly searches in order to understand God. The gatherings would take place in places removed from villages and not frequented by people as picnic sites or leisure resorts. The remote places of prayer were normally in the hills or in the thickness of virgin forests. We chose sites near rivers for fresh water to drink and bath.",
                "4. Many who came would join the church, choose to be baptised and accept the teaching and ways of God as was taught by Jesus, Matthew 28:18 - 20; Acts 2:41 - 42.",
                "We preached that we must love and serve God accepting the transcendent reality of God. We taught the people the birth, baptism, and death of Jesus Christ which formed the bedrock of worship, our teaching and life of our membership. The process was akin to the African way of life, one is born, grows through adulthood, married life and proceeds to death. Jesus Christ was the only example of fulfilment of the conditions of a perfect member of the Church, and therefore of the community.",

                "The pointer-vision was central to the development of the Church, the timing was far from bizarre. Zimbabwe, which is a multiracial culture, a cauldron of practices, attitudes, resentments, mistrust, confusion, and despair could not have been so aptly regarded by the Creator Himself. If the path to liberation was to be through the barrel of the gun, the word of God, and Prayer was a stronger weapon and more than essential for the road to peace in our country. I recall that the voice of the Lord reeled out the verses in response to desperate cries of help made through prayer. Much of the nationalist leadership was now incarcerated in detention. The political ship was a radar less vessel deliberately confused by the repressive government edicts and effective harassment by state policy. The oppressed were eating into themselves with backbiting, sell-outs and blatant betrayals for little gain. Brother was going against brother. Hatred and mistrust had taken root, superstition and fear of the unknown was on the increase. A common factor taught in mainstream congregations propagated that salvation came after death and the final judgement.",
                "The disparity in the distribution of basic human rights, health care, housing, education, social services, remuneration at work the grossly unfair land allocation served to command the sharp and confrontational stance between the ruled and their rulers. Our talk was clear, we were to explain that at the apex of the life hierarchy was Jesus Christ. Our Lord wished for us to be free to worship Him and He had died for us, Africans too though we were wretched, poor and generally regarded as ignorant.",
                "Racially discriminating policies made for the disaffection of the subjugated African people. Their anger and resentment at the extortion of their land, the suppression of their customs and importantly the distortion of the gospel by the Christian leadership made it imperative for us to provide hope, explain the hidden message of truth, the equality of races in the house of creation and the love of God and His concern for their salvation. Jesus brought salvation for all, his coming eliminated this evidential and rampant suffering in Rhodesia. God did not ignore the deep-seated needs of our followers and through Jesus Christ, oppression, envy, war and destruction would be removed. Jesus Christ healed the sick, raised the dead and cast out demons at no charge. Witchcraft, ill-luck bareness, sorrow, blindness, sorcery, severe depression, loss of hope were readily removed by Jesus from all who come to him in faith.",
                "The advent of a ruling colonial power imposed a method of prayer that replaced a Godfearing practice and worship. The African people were allowed to worship spirits of the dead, this was not allowed in contradiction with the power of Christ but made for easy control and influence of our people as they could not settle into a particular belief and be developed in it. So, it was that our task became an exercise in the liberation of mind, behaviour, concept, worship and practice. God gave man the gift of healing, the supremacy over evil, and the ability to receive messages and guidance to prayer, vision and dream all in the name of Jesus Christ, the Mediator, the Redeemer, the Saviour, the Healer, and above all, the Liberator of the heart; the mind and the soul. No people by race-were-superior over others - the time had come for a reiteration of that equality to the people of Zimbabwe, the Africans and indeed all the people of the world.",

A discussion on the gospel of God followed and the Holy Spirit would lift me up, make me flip my feet in the air, I would run to and fro singing the words, \"Friends how will we ascend to heaven?\"",

                "2. We continued flying together away from the mountains and heading north. We turned west to head for Harare. The pair began to ask me questions, \"Ko, said the woman, \"Who might you be? What is it that you do for a living, what is your occupation?\"",
                "3. I was made to reply in English, “I am the angel of Africa, the only Ernest Mwazha in Southern Rhodesia.”",

                "3. I raised my head toward this magnificent looking man as he spoke, and turned to the north. I swayed to look to the south and noticed an ongoing and frightening change to the landscape. The roads and paved walkways had become deep gorges. The river that flowed under high bridges were now dangerous masses of water rushing to sea. The large dongas were impassable trenches with no bridges straddling them. The site was not pleasant to look at.",
                "4. We still stood on the rock. I spoke to this brilliantly white figure before I noticed a group of men dash toward tractors and earth movers. The workmen moved heavy duty road building equipment they were to use to repair the road. They worked moving north to south in the intensity of their task. A tarmac surface was soon laid out stretching by the rock upon which our spectator group stood.",

Although covered with bees it dripped invitingly of a rich and ripe honey. I realised that no one had dared harvest the syrup for fear of the wrath of the protective bees. The belief that the swarm was sacred had helped preserve the bees as no one dared rattle the bees for their thick rich and mature honey.",
